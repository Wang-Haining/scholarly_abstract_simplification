We found out that neon can mix with water to make a type of ice. The neon atoms can move around freely inside the ice. Computer simulations showed that this new ice is stable at high pressure and low temperature. The neon atoms mostly vibrate up and down, and they are also affected by the nearby neon atoms."

Viruses like to use a trick to avoid the body's defense system and keep spreading. We discovered that SARS-CoV-2 can stop certain signals in our cells that help fight viruses. This happens because of a protein called Orf6 in the virus. Orf6 blocks some important movements in our cells, making it hard for our body to fight the virus. By changing a specific part of Orf6, we can stop this blockage and help our body fight the virus better. This shows how the virus tries to outsmart our body's defenses."

Zinc is a substance that can stop Hv1 channels from working. In guys, zinc makes sure sperm stays still, but once in girls, sperm gets active because there is less zinc. We're not sure exactly how zinc stops Hv1 from working. This study uses a special technique to figure out how zinc does this. The results show that zinc sticks to Hv1 in two ways, which stops the channel from sensing voltage changes and opening up. Some changes in Hv1 can affect how zinc stops the channel from sensing voltage changes, while other changes can also affect how zinc stops the channel from opening up. This happens in Hv1 channels whether they are alone or in pairs. We think that zinc blocks Hv1 in two main ways: at low amounts, zinc stops the channel from opening up to let protons through, and at high amounts, zinc also stops the channel from moving in response to voltage changes. Understanding how zinc stops Hv1 will help us learn more about how Hv1 works and could help in making new medicines to target Hv1 channels."

We looked at data on corn production and climate changes to see how corn yield will change as the Earth gets warmer. We found that as the temperature goes up, corn yield becomes more unpredictable and decreases in many countries. This will lead to more uncertainty in food production and prices, especially for the poorest people. We need to invest in developing crops that can handle high temperatures."

This helps keep a variety of animals alive. Scientists have been studying how big plant-eating animals share food for a long time. They found that some animals eat mostly grass while others eat other plants. Also, they noticed that animals might eat different parts of the same plant. But it's hard to know exactly which plants each animal eats using traditional methods. In a study in Africa, scientists used a new method to see what seven different big plant-eating animals liked to eat. Some animals mostly ate grass, while others preferred other plants. Animals that were similar in size and ate a lot of grass tended to eat similar things. But even animals that looked alike sometimes had different diets. This suggests that simply putting animals in categories like 'grazers' or 'browsers' might not tell the whole story about how they compete and survive together. It also shows that the variety of plants might be more important for keeping these animals alive than we thought."

We found out a few things. First, some businesses had to let go of workers and shut down soon after the crisis started. Second, businesses that thought the crisis would last longer were more likely to close. Also, different businesses had different ideas about how long the disruptions would last. Third, many small businesses didn't have much money saved up. For example, the typical business spending over $10,000 a month only had enough cash for about 2 weeks. Fourth, most businesses wanted help from the CARES Act. But they were worried about facing challenges like dealing with lots of paperwork and proving they were eligible. We also looked at how many businesses applied for loans compared to grants, and how resilient they were during the crisis."

They guessed the power of the engines wrongly. We looked at three types of boats: small traditional, small with engines, and big industrial ones. We saw that from 1950 to 2015, the number of fishing boats in the world doubled from 1.7 million to 3.7 million. Most of the new boats had engines. By 2015, 68% of all fishing boats had engines. Even though most boats are small, they don't have much power. The total power of all engines together went up a lot. But even with more boats and power, the amount of fish caught by each boat has been going down. This means the oceans are getting overfished. In 2015, most countries were catching only a fifth of what they caught in the 1950s. This is a global problem. Some countries are starting to manage their fishing better by having fewer boats. In the future, more boats with engines will join the fishing fleets, which can be a challenge for keeping fish stocks healthy."

People with MSA usually die within a few years of getting sick. The main problem in MSA is the build-up of a protein called alpha-synuclein in the brain cells. Scientists think this build-up of alpha-synuclein is what causes the brain damage in MSA. A new medicine called VX-765 has been tested in mice with a disease like MSA. The medicine helped the sick mice move better and reduced the build-up of alpha-synuclein in their brains. It also protected some important brain cells. This shows that VX-765 might be a good treatment for diseases like MSA by stopping the build-up of alpha-synuclein.

It is influenced by how cells get energy, keep a balance of chemicals, and communicate with each other. Some changes in specific genes that often occur in cancer cells make them resistant to ferroptosis, but blocking a certain cell communication pathway can make them vulnerable again. This resistance involves a series of events that lead to the production of fats that protect the cells. By stopping this fat production, cancer cells become sensitive to ferroptosis. In experiments with mice having breast or prostate cancer, combining two treatments led to significant shrinkage of tumors. This shows that targeting specific cell functions can be a promising approach for cancer treatment."

Birds that like older forests were expected to do better on federal land but worse on private land. Birds that like young forests were expected to do worse on federal land. The number of older forest birds actually went down faster than expected. This is because of forest fires and cutting trees on private land. The plan thought it would take time to bring back older forests. Some areas with young forests stayed the same, but in some places, they went down.

The adult mice had problems with their immune system, like swollen lymph nodes and issues in their lungs, stomach, pancreas, and salivary glands. They also had antibodies attacking their own organs. Removing CTLA-4 in adult mice made a type of helpful immune cells grow more, but these mice could pass on their sickness to other mice. When we transferred cells from these mice to other mice, they got heart inflammation which was not seen in the original sick mice.

This gene is important in how Alzheimer’s happens, but we’re not sure exactly how it works. Recently, we discovered that brain cells called astrocytes, which make the APOE gene, help clean up the brain and get rid of old connections. The E2 gene makes astrocytes clean up faster, while the E4 gene slows it down. We also found that the amount of a protein called C1q in the brain depends on which APOE gene a person has. This protein might lead to faster brain cell damage in people with the E4 gene. This shows that the E4 gene might increase the risk of Alzheimer’s because it makes astrocytes clean up slower, causing more damage to brain cells."

This study looked at how brains changed in animals that lay eggs by counting the number of neurons. They found that reptiles not only have small brains compared to their bodies but also fewer neurons, unlike birds and mammals. There were four big changes in how brains and neurons grew in animals. The biggest changes happened when birds and mammals developed more neurons, which helped them think better. Other big changes in neuron numbers occurred in certain birds and primates, which are known for being smart.

Through experiments with cells that lack TRAP1 or have too much of it, scientists found that TRAP1 helps control how cells use energy. Cells without TRAP1 use more energy from mitochondria and fats, while their sugar use goes down. These cells also become more aggressive. TRAP1 interacts with a protein in mitochondria, which explains these effects. Additionally, low levels of TRAP1 seem to be linked to more aggressive cancers.

When ADF/cofilin cuts the filaments that are twisted, it creates a twisting force that helps cutting even more. Our experiments show that this twisting force makes ADF/cofilin cut much faster.

Scientists are starting to realize that the instructions for making proteins in cells can also be changed after they are made. These changes can affect how fast proteins are made and how they work. We studied how a common RNA change called pseudouridine (Ψ) affects making proteins in bacteria and human cells. We found that replacing a certain building block in the instructions with Ψ slows down making proteins. We also saw this when we looked at the structure of a special molecule in cells. Ψ can make cells produce different proteins from the same instructions, and it can affect how a specific building block is added to the protein. Most Ψ changes are found in the protein-making instructions, and our study shows that encountering Ψ can slightly change how fast proteins are made and how instructions are read."

We studied the body sizes of many living and extinct mammals to see how the size of aquatic mammals has changed over time. Our research shows that most aquatic mammals are evolving to be around 500 kg in size. This size seems to be the best for them because it balances the energy they need to stay warm with the energy they get from feeding. These findings suggest that living in water makes mammals grow bigger to meet the energy demands of the environment."

They do this using special hairs called type IV pili. These hairs attach to the surface, then pull back a bit, sending a signal to the bacteria's sensing system. This system helps the bacteria make important decisions like producing certain proteins and turning on specific genes that can make them harmful. The more the bacteria touch the surface, the more active these hairs become, helping the bacteria stick to the surface better. The sensors on the hairs can detect changes in their shape caused by touching the surface. This shows that P. aeruginosa uses these special hairs not only to move on surfaces but also to sense and control their behavior when they touch surfaces."

It used to be the most popular renewable energy source in the world, making up 71% of it in 2016. Many big dams were built in North America and Europe between 1920 and 1970. But in developed countries, they stopped building big dams because the best spots were taken and people were worried about the environment and social problems. Now, they are taking down more dams than they are building in North America and Europe. The hydropower industry moved to building dams in developing countries, like along the Mekong River, Amazon River, and Congo River. But building these dams caused problems like hurting the river's plants and animals, cutting down forests, releasing harmful gases, moving people out of their homes, and changing how people live and grow food. This study looks at why developing countries are building so many big dams and why it's important to think about climate change when deciding to build one. We also talk about the problems of thinking dams are better than they really are and not realizing how much they cost. We need to make changes to listen to the worries of people who live near where dams are being planned. Finally, we suggest new ideas to make hydropower more sustainable, along with solar and wind power."

Even before these harmful substances build up in the brain, certain brain cells start to release signals that activate the immune system. These signals come from brain cells that have too much of a toxic substance called Aβ. When studying brain cells from rats with early signs of Alzheimer's, researchers found that these cells produce signals that activate the immune system. These signals are unique to the brain cells with too much Aβ, and they can trigger the immune response even before the harmful substances form clumps in the brain. This research suggests that brain cells with high levels of Aβ play a key role in the inflammation seen in Alzheimer's disease."

Then, after a slower step, all the proteins end up with the same shape. This shape is made up of parts that are far apart in the protein's sequence but close together in the final shape. Some parts that change early don't affect the final shape, while others do. This shape lasts through the rest of the folding process. It includes spots where mutations slow down folding. This shows that this shape is a necessary step in the folding process. The protein then takes a longer time to fold completely, possibly in more than one step. The first step looks similar to the shape formed in the earlier step. This study adds to our understanding of how big proteins fold in different ways."

However, a key enzyme that usually removes this cap in bacteria is turned off by the same stress conditions that cause the RNA to accumulate. Instead, another enzyme called RppH steps in to do the job. It prefers to work on RNA with the cap, and it has a unique way of recognizing and breaking down these capped RNA molecules. This leads to a shift in its usual behavior, resulting in a different end product. To fully break down the RNA, another step is needed after RppH's work.

However, we don't know much about how these proteins are built, how well they work against plant diseases caused by fungi, and how they fight off these fungi. Researchers recently figured out the shape of one of these proteins called NCR044. It is mostly messy and always changing, with a small twisted part and a flat part held together by special chemical bonds. NCR044 can kill various types of fungi that harm plants, like Botrytis cinerea and three types of Fusarium. It can stop these fungi from growing and even destroy them. When these fungi try to grow, NCR044 attacks their outer layer and makes them produce harmful substances. In lab tests, NCR044 was found to stick to certain important molecules inside the fungi. By looking at the fungi under a special microscope, researchers saw that NCR044 first attaches to the outer layer of the fungi, then enters their cells through specific points. This causes the fungi to lose their structure and eventually die. When NCR044 was sprayed on tomato and tobacco plants, as well as on harvested products, it greatly reduced the damage caused by Botrytis cinerea. This research shows how a unique protein like NCR044 can help protect plants from harmful fungi and could be used as a spray to prevent plant diseases in the future."

Applying a certain amount of force can make these proteins switch to a different state that helps them stick faster to the platelets. This force can also make the proteins stay together longer.

Some channels have two gates: one for quick activation/deactivation and the other for slow inactivation/recovery. A specific potassium channel, BK, lacks a typical gate and doesn't usually inactivate. We thought that the BK channel's activation gate might overlap with the inactivation gate. We made BK channels inactivate and studied how it relates to activation/deactivation. We found that BK channels can inactivate slowly with low potassium levels and certain mutations. Most channels inactivate when open and recover when closed, but BK channels inactivate when closed and recover when open. Mutations that keep the channel open prevent inactivation. We believe that inactivation in BK channels depends on the closed state and happens when the channel is less likely to be open. This inactivation process might involve changes in the channel's structure at a specific part. We think that when the BK channel closes normally, it's actually starting the inactivation process."

Scientists have been studying how the parasite enters the cells and have focused on certain proteins and pathways involved. They have mostly ignored the idea that the parasite might change the red blood cell itself to help it get in. One specific protein called EBA175 is important for the parasite to enter the cells by binding to another protein on the cell surface. We found that this binding makes the red blood cell stiffer and its membrane less flexible, making it easier for the parasite to invade. This discovery suggests that the parasite changes the red blood cell to make it easier for itself to get in, instead of just forcing its way in."

They want to know if diamond, which usually doesn't conduct electricity, could become a metal just by stretching it really hard, without shaking apart. They used math and computer models to show that diamond can turn into a metal and back again when you stretch it just the right amount. They figured out how to make diamond into a metal by stretching it in different ways. They also looked at when diamond might start to change into a different material called graphite. These discoveries could help us change how diamond works for things like electronics and fancy new technologies."

We did an experiment with mice to see how being in dry air affects how sick they get from the flu. We found that low humidity makes mice more likely to get really sick from the flu. Breathing in dry air makes it harder for the body to fight the virus and heal itself. Mice without a certain gene were less affected by the flu in dry air. Looking at the cells in the lungs, we saw that the body's response to the virus was weaker in dry air. This shows that being in dry air weakens the body's ability to fight the flu and heal, leading to more severe illness."

We found that the brain gets more active with each word in a sentence but calms down when words fit together in a group. This shows that the brain has a special way of putting words together to make sense of them. Our study suggests that the brain organizes words like building blocks to form sentences. This process helps us understand language better."

Another part of the brain related to feeling good is also involved in controlling eating habits. By turning on these brain cells, it stops other cells from stopping them, which leads to more happy signals being sent out. We wanted to see how these brain cells affect eating habits. When we made mice full and then turned on these brain cells, they quickly went to get food and kept eating for a short time. But when we tried to stop the cells in a different part of the brain, it didn't work. Also, making the happy cells in another part of the brain more active didn't make the mice eat more. We found that some brain signals travel to another part of the brain, which then makes the mice want to eat. When we stopped these signals, the mice didn't eat as much. It seems like these signals are important for making animals eat too much, even though it doesn't change their weight. This might be linked to why some animals become overweight."

Our research shows that the program helped reduce the loss of trees, especially in places where the danger was the highest. The program made community members feel like the forest monitors had authority and their patrols were more effective than usual patrols.

These effects were seen right after the 2016 election and also in the months that followed. Believing in HM was linked to less trust in the government, more sexism, racism, and xenophobia. Even with these negative attitudes, believing in HM still predicted support for Trump. The study also found that attitudes towards Trump's opponents, like Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020, were influenced by social and prejudiced views.

Compared to growing corn every year and digging up the soil a lot, other ways like digging less, planting different crops, using manure, or having rotating pastures did not increase the carbon in the soil much. But having rotating pastures with animals added more carbon than any other way after 29 years. This matches what other studies have found around the world.

They use siderophores to control iron levels, but haven't found a similar way for copper yet. In this study, we show that in a type of fungus called Aspergillus fumigatus, certain substances from a specific gene group can bind to copper, change how much copper is inside the cells, and fight against harmful microbes that need metal to survive. These substances are released by the fungus and can be seen binding to copper using special tests. Testing on Aspergillus fumigatus together with other harmful fungi and bacteria revealed that the substances from this gene group only work with copper to stop the growth of these harmful microbes. This suggests that these substances play a new role in how fungi deal with copper and compete with other microbes."

We found that in places where frosts are common, trees are more careful about growing leaves too early. In places where frosts used to be rare, trees are quicker to react to warming temperatures. As frosts increase in some regions, we expect more damage to European and Asian forests compared to North American forests.

In a study using a model of colitis, researchers found that Th17 cells without a protein called IFN-gamma stayed as Th17 cells and did not cause colitis in other animals. To cause disease, some Th17 cells need to change into Th1-like cells, which depends on certain proteins in the body. Additionally, some Th17 cells can help create pathogenic Th1 cells from other special cells. This study shows that Th17 cells are important in causing colitis in two ways: by changing into Th1-like cells and by helping create classic Th1 cells."

Now, we have found a fast way to change skin cells from living ALS patients into special brain cells that can harm nerve cells. When we put these brain cells with nerve cells in a dish, they hurt the nerve cells, especially in people with certain gene mutations. The brain cells from people with ALS who don't have these gene mutations are also harmful. This shows that there might be a common reason why these cells hurt nerve cells.

We found that all Malagasy people have ancestors from Bantu and Austronesian groups, with a small mix from Europe and the Middle East. The population grew quickly in the past thousand years. Different parts of the island show more African or Asian ancestry, suggesting separate groups settled there. The way people live in different areas affects their genes, even in just a few hundred years."

Some of these RNAs can also make a small protein. We found one RNA that can change how a bacteria called Escherichia coli uses carbon. This RNA is 164 pieces long and can make a 28-piece protein called AzuC. AzuC works with a protein called GlpD to help the bacteria break down stuff faster. Too much of this RNA can make the bacteria grow slowly in certain types of food. Even when we change the RNA a little, the bacteria still grow slowly in one type of food. This RNA can also stop two genes from working by sticking to them. The protein AzuC can stop this from happening, but the RNA can stop the protein from being made. This shows that the RNA and the protein are like rivals in the bacteria's body."

These systems today use weather info, plant growth models, and pictures from satellites. But they don't use old info like reports from experts who have studied crops for a long time. We think these expert reports, even though they are based on opinions and categories, are better at showing how well crops are doing than any computer model or satellite picture. This is because the reports bring together the knowledge of many experts from different places, making a smart network of 'people as sensors' that give accurate info on crops. We looked at data from surveys done by the US Department of Agriculture about four main crops in the US from 1987 to 2019. We found a way to change the reports into numbers that are easier to study. Even though the reports come from different people in different areas, the models we use to describe crop conditions are strong and work well for all kinds of crops. We talk about where biases in the survey data come from and how we can understand them. Lastly, we suggest a number scale to show crop conditions based on the surveys. This scale can help us keep an eye on crops and make better guesses about how much they will produce earlier than the official forecasts from the USDA."

One idea says that our brain stays active to keep information. Another idea suggests that memory is like a shortcut in our brain. We think memory is helped by the brain changing how much it fires. Our brain's cells react to what we experience and change how they work. These changes help us remember things for a short time. Our brain writes and reads information using different speeds. It doesn't need to keep being active or use shortcuts to remember. Instead, the brain uses special ways to remember that lower how much it fires. This way of remembering is linked to how long it takes to adapt and how much the brain fires normally. Sometimes, remembering can be hard if the brain is too used to something. Our brain can remember things better when they are linked to the order they happen. This way of remembering helps us understand language and keep track of information over time. This research helps us understand how our brain deals with language."

We looked at a lot of data from around the world about how soil breathes, the amount of moisture in the soil, and how hot or cold it is. We found that in most places, the soil's breathing didn't change much when it got warmer, except in deserts and boreal forests. When the soil is not in a desert, its breathing increases as it gets warmer, but only up to a certain point. After that, the breathing slows down as it gets even hotter. This shows that different places might react differently to higher temperatures. Our study helps us understand how soil carbon levels might change as the Earth gets warmer."

By looking at different sets of data and how pain is defined, we found that middle-aged Americans today have had more pain in their lives compared to older Americans today. When we look at different groups of people based on when they were born and their level of education, we see that those with less education have more pain as they get older. This trend is not the same for those with a bachelor's degree. The difference in pain between people with more and less education is getting bigger with each new group of people born.

With the help of these tools, they found out how different parts of this molecule behave. They also saw a water molecule that helps a specific part of the enzyme do its job. By studying all these details, scientists could understand why one molecule works in a certain way but another one doesn't. This helps them learn more about how enzymes work and how they can be controlled."

In this study, we wanted to know how giving a certain kind of sugar to a squid helps keep their glowing bacteria friend happy and stable. The bacteria live inside a special part of the squid that helps it glow. The squid makes a sugary substance called chitin in special cells that help fight off germs. We found that just before nighttime, these cells move into the glowing bacteria's home and release chitin pieces. This behavior only happens when the relationship between the squid and the bacteria is strong. Both the squid and the bacteria have specific times when they use and break down the chitin, mostly at night. We discovered that when the bacteria couldn't break down the chitin, they could only live inside the squid for a short time. The chitin breakdown also helps make the bacteria's home slightly acidic every night, which gives them more oxygen to glow brightly. We think other animals might also control the behavior of their helpful microbes by giving them specific nutrients that affect their living conditions."

A program was tested in middle schools to help teachers be more understanding when giving out punishments. It showed that student suspensions decreased by half, and students who were suspended before felt more respected by their teachers.

The virus needs special proteins to attach to cells and infect them. These proteins are cut in a specific order to allow the virus to enter cells. When we blocked the first cuts in these proteins, the virus had a hard time infecting lung cells but could still infect other types of cells. This happened because the proteins couldn't change shape properly to enter the cells. Viruses that were already cut were better at infecting lung cells because they had the right tools to enter them. Understanding how these proteins are cut can help us figure out how the virus spreads and causes disease."

When STING is missing, the body has trouble using sugar from food but also has a harder time releasing insulin from the pancreas. In people with type 2 diabetes, STING levels are lower in the pancreas. This suggests that STING might be important for how well the pancreas works. Further tests showed that without STING, certain genes in the pancreas that help with insulin secretion are not working properly.

We found that changes in how nutrients move around when it's hot are a major reason why the coral and algae partnership breaks down. When the coral gets hot, it needs more energy, so it breaks down some substances to get it. This causes the coral to release more nutrients that help the algae grow and make food for both. But this change in how they share resources can lead to a problem where the coral doesn't get enough food from the algae.

It can store a lot of energy and works well in a specific type of liquid. When paired with another material, it creates a battery with high energy capacity.

We found a new way that nerve cells can heal, which doesn't need certain proteins usually involved in healing in worms, flies, and mammals. In worms, this new healing is connected to another way nerve cells can grow abnormally when they're hurt or have certain gene changes. These connections show that this abnormal growth can help us find new genes related to healing nerve cells. This new healing in worms is similar to a way brains can heal after being hurt in mammals. Both ways are helped by lowering brain activity and changing certain chemicals. Our research brings together different ways nerve cells can grow to learn more about how the brain can heal itself."

In healthy people, one main brain network is similar to a network that is active when we are daydreaming. But in people with Parkinson's disease, this network is not as active and another network related to the disease becomes more active. They also found that the brain works differently when doing tasks, depending on if someone is healthy or has Parkinson's disease. The brain scans showed that in advanced Parkinson's disease, the brain does not switch off the daydreaming network as much as it should, but this can be improved with medication. Comparing brain scans over time showed that changes in brain activity happen later in Parkinson's disease compared to Alzheimer's disease.

Our tests showed that FSIP1 interacts with a protein called ULK1. When FSIP1 was removed, it led to more autophagy and changes in certain cell signaling pathways. Blocking autophagy or a protein called AMPK helped make the TNBC cells respond better to chemotherapy. These results suggest that FSIP1 plays a key role in drug sensitivity in TNBC and could help in developing better treatments."

We found that as temperatures get hotter or colder, more species are needed to keep things going smoothly. This is because different species have different abilities to handle different temperatures.

Scientists discovered that the FT gene in dodder plants might not work the same way as in other plants. By studying soybean and tobacco plants, scientists found out that the FT protein from the host plant helps both the host and the dodder plant to bloom. The FT protein from the host plant travels to the dodder plant and tells it to start flowering. This research shows that the FT protein is an important signal for plants to know when to bloom.

However, it's not clear how this pathway and silicon work together when plants are attacked by insects. To better understand this, scientists made changes to certain genes in rice plants to see how they respond to insect attacks after being treated with silicon. They found that silicon helps rice plants protect themselves from insect larvae, but only in normal plants, not in plants with altered genes. When attacked by insects, normal plants treated with silicon showed stronger defense responses compared to plants without silicon treatment. These responses included increased levels of certain substances, more active defense genes, and higher activities of certain enzymes. Plants with altered genes showed less silicon accumulation and smaller silicon cells compared to normal plants. They also had lower levels of certain genes that help transport silicon. These findings show that silicon and the special pathway work together to help plants defend against insects by activating the defense responses and promoting silicon accumulation."

One idea says our brain stays active to keep information in memory. Another idea suggests that memory is like a quick boost in connections between brain cells. Our new idea is that memory is helped by the brain's ability to change how much it fires. The way a single brain cell reacts depends on what it has experienced. We used computer simulations to show how these changes help us remember things for a short time. Our brain writes information by making cells fire in a special way, and then reads it back to think about it. This memory process doesn't need constant activity, positive feedback, or changes in connections between cells. Instead, our brain uses adjustable abilities to help remember and recall information quickly. How much we can remember is linked to how fast our brain can change and how active it normally is. Problems with remembering can happen when changes in the brain last a long time. We found that this memory process is good at remembering words in the right order and connecting them over time.

We used different methods to study a big carbon change and warming event that happened about 304 million years ago during an ice age. We found that there was a lot of carbon in the air, which caused a drop in biodiversity. This carbon came from a lot of organic matter that was added to the Earth over a long time. The Earth's system showed that low oxygen levels in the sea were linked to the warm period."

They use a certification called RSPO to show they are following the rules. In 2017, about 20% of the world's palm oil was certified by RSPO. But we don't know if this certification really stops forests from being cut down. We studied palm oil plantations in Indonesia, the top palm oil producer, to see if being certified by RSPO helps protect forests. We found that even though forests were still being lost and there were fires, certified palm oil was linked to less deforestation. Certification reduced deforestation by 33%. But many plantations didn't have much forest left when they got certified. By 2015, less than 1% of forests in Indonesian palm oil plantations were in certified areas. Certification didn't really help in peatlands or stopping fires. To truly protect forests and the climate, more plantations need to be certified, no peat should be used, and forests need to be closely monitored for loss."

Problems with this complex can lead to diseases like diabetes and cancer. Scientists study this complex using mutants in simple organisms like Arabidopsis thaliana but it's challenging because these mutants can be lethal or have severe effects. We found that a small molecule called Endosidin2 (ES2) can stop exocytosis in plants and humans by interacting with a part of the exocyst complex. This molecule can also help with moving materials inside plant cells. Changing a part of a protein in the exocyst complex makes it resistant to ES2, revealing new information about how this complex works. This research not only helps us understand exocytosis better but also suggests a new target for medicines to treat diseases in humans."

But in some species, there are many genes that work together to decide if an animal is a boy, a girl, or something in between. We studied a type of fish called Metriaclima mbenjii that can have four different sexes because of these genes. This means they can look and act in different ways. These genes also affect their body parts and how they behave in their tank. Unlike most animals that have male and female, these fish can have many different variations. Studying these differences helps us understand how animals change over time."

We used a drug called deferiprone to lower iron levels in mice, which resulted in less damage to their eyes. On the other hand, mice with too much iron in their eye cells had more eye damage. Our experiments showed that reducing iron levels using deferiprone can help protect the eyes from damage caused by light and other harmful substances."

However, in certain predators, changes for catching prey are focused in specific body parts. One example is siphonophores, a group of sea creatures that use specialized tentacles to catch food. We studied how these creatures that are specialists in catching prey evolve compared to those that are not specialists, and what changes happen in their bodies during this process. We looked at 29 different characteristics of tentacles from 45 siphonophore species, created a family tree to see how they are related, and analyzed how their body features are linked to the type of prey they catch. We found that specialist siphonophores can become generalists, and that those specialized in one type of prey can switch to another. The shape of their tentacles is closely related to the type of prey they eat, and changes in prey type are connected to changes in tentacle shape and how their bodies evolve. Studying how siphonophores have evolved to catch prey helps us understand how different predators have adapted over time. This research helps us see how specialization and changes in body shape have influenced the food chain we see today."

They don't have many hand bones from a specific time period when people started using stone tools. New findings show that a special hand bone in modern humans was also in an ancient human from Kenya. This bone suggests that some important hand features in humans appeared early in our evolution.

These vitamin units help make important substances needed for cell growth. In animals, there are two types of SHMT enzymes, and the one in the cell's powerhouse is extra active in cancer. By removing both types of SHMT in cancer cells, we can stop colon cancer growth. We found some chemicals that can block these enzymes in human cells. Testing these chemicals on cancer cells showed that some types of blood cells are very affected by the block. Giving cells a different molecule can help them survive the block, but in some blood cancers, this actually makes the block more harmful. This is because these cancer cells have trouble taking in a molecule called glycine, which they need to grow. Fixing this problem could be a way to treat these cancers."

But often, we forget about how forests can help people eat better, especially in poor rural areas. This study in Tanzania looked at how cutting down trees over 5 years affected what people ate. They found that cutting trees reduced the amount of fruits and veggies people ate, making their diets lacking in vitamin A. On the other hand, when trees were broken up into smaller pieces, people ate more fruits and veggies, getting enough vitamin A. This shows that cutting down forests can make people eat less healthy, while keeping forests can help people eat better. This is important for policymakers to consider when planning how to improve nutrition and protect the environment."

But these machines are getting heavier, which can hurt the soil underground. We found that even though the pressure on the surface hasn't changed much over time, the soil deeper down is getting squished too much. We made a map that shows where the soil is at risk of getting too compacted based on how much machinery is used, tractor size, soil type, and weather. More than 20% of land we can farm is at risk of losing productivity because of this soil squishing. We need to make sure our machines are designed better to protect the soil. The machines we use now are getting as heavy as the biggest dinosaurs, and they might have caused similar problems long ago. Maybe the ancient dinosaurs had ways to avoid hurting the land, like using specific paths to walk on."
