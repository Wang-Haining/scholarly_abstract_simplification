The molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 is not completely understood. We use the voltage clamp technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. Mutations of some Hv1 residues affect only Zn2+ inhibition of the voltage sensor motion, whereas mutations of other residues also affect Zn2+ inhibition of gate opening. These effects are similar in monomeric and dimeric Hv1 channels, suggesting that the Zn2+-binding sites are localized within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Z"

They are also the most widely distributed, with a global range of ∼1.5 million km2. Yet, the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape their diversity and abundance are poorly understood. Here, we use DNA metabarcoding to quantify diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species in the African savanna. We find that diet composition differs between species, even when they are similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. This suggests that coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.

Finally, we find that anaerobic gut fungi synthesize a compound, putatively identified as the polyketide-related styrylpyrone baumin, that is unique to anaerobic gut fungi.

Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety. Here we show that the nucleus accumbens, a brain region involved in social behavior, is particularly sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction. We demonstrate that the nucleus accumbens of high-anxious rats has reduced mitochondrial complex I and II proteins and respiratory capacity, and increased oxidative stress. We also show that pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial complex I or II or administration of nicotinamide, an amide form of vitamin B3, can prevent the development of a subordinate status in high-anxious animals. Our findings highlight a key role for mitochondrial function in social behavior and point to mitochondrial function in the nucleus accumbens as a potential marker and avenue of treatment for anxiety-related social disorders.

However, the molecular basis of this diversification remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the evolution of plant-feeding habits in beetles was enabled by the codiversification of a suite of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) via horizontal gene transfers from bacteria and fungi. We infer that the diversification of beetles was facilitated by the acquisition of these enzymes, which enabled efficient digestion of plant tissues, including lignocellulose in cell walls, and thus the evolution of specialized plant-feeding habits, such as leaf mining and stem and wood boring.

Here, we show that the APOE isoforms E2 and E4 have opposing effects on the phagocytic capacity of astrocytes, which is highly dependent on the APOE isoform. We also show that the rate of C1q accumulation in the hippocampus, which may represent the accumulation of senescent synapses with enhanced vulnerability to complement-mediated degeneration, is highly dependent on the APOE isoform. These studies reveal a novel allele-dependent role for APOE in regulating the rate of synapse pruning by astrocytes. They also suggest the hypothesis that AD susceptibility of APOE4 may originate in part from defective phagocytic capacity of astrocytes which accelerates the rate of accumulation of C1q-coated senescent synapses, enhancing synaptic vulnerability to classical-complement-cascade mediated neurodegeneration.

The most widely accepted hypothesis is that body size is constrained by the energetic costs of thermoregulation. However, the energetic costs of thermoregulation are not the only costs that constrain body size. The energetic costs of feeding are also important, and the aquatic environment imposes unique constraints on feeding efficiency. We use a combination of comparative phylogenetic analysis and examination of the fossil record to show that the evolution of body size in aquatic mammals is driven by the energetic costs of thermoregulation and feeding efficiency. We find that the three extant aquatic mammal clades are converging toward a common optimum size of ∼500 kg. This optimum size is consistent with the energetic costs of thermoregulation and feeding efficiency. The existence of this optimum size and the rapid selection toward it rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase.

We demonstrate that the Aβ-burdened neuron is a primary source of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which may be the first step in the pathogenesis of AD.
The most common form of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. The pathophysiology of AD is not fully understood, but it is known that the disease is associated with the accumulation of Aβ and NFTs in the brain. However, the exact role of these pathological changes in the development of AD is not clear.
In this study, we demonstrate that the Aβ-burdened neuron is a primary source of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which may be the first step in the pathogenesis of AD. We found that the Aβ-burdened neuron is a primary source of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which may be the"

We have discovered a structurally unique class of peptides, the NCR-peptides, which exhibit potent antifungal activity against multiple plant fungal pathogens. We have solved the three-dimensional structure of the NCR-peptide, NCR044, and demonstrated its antifungal activity in vitro and in vivo. We have also shown that NCR044 can be spray-applied to plants to reduce gray mold disease symptoms caused by the fungal pathogen B. cinerea. Our work illustrates the antifungal activity of a structurally unique class of peptides against plant fungal pathogens and paves the way for future development of this class of peptides as a spray-on fungistat/fungicide.

We used mass spectrometry to characterize the postmating sperm proteome in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the sperm proteome undergoes substantial compositional changes after mating, and that the majority of the postmating sperm proteome is derived from the female. We also found that the postmating sperm proteome is enriched for proteins associated with energy metabolism, suggesting that female contributions support sperm viability during the prolonged period between copulation and fertilization.

The parasite invades the erythrocyte, where it replicates and causes disease. The parasite’s invasion is mediated by a protein called EBA175, which binds to a receptor on the erythrocyte surface, glycophorin A. We show that binding of EBA175 to glycophorin A alters the physical properties of the erythrocyte, making it easier for the parasite to invade. This finding has important implications for the development of new antimalarial drugs.

We found that stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) with optogenetic light activates eating in sated mice. Lesions of the LH or its downstream targets, the substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC), failed to disrupt this effect. We found that some of the LH’s GABA neurons synapse onto LC neurons, and stimulation of these GABA neurons in the LC induced eating. Lesions of these GABA neurons blocked LH stimulation-induced eating. Thus, we present a characterization of brain circuitry that may promote overeating and contribute to obesity.

We find that the program reduced deforestation by 8.4 ha per community in the first year and 3.3 ha in the second year. The program’s effects were largest in communities facing the largest threats. We also find that the program’s monitors were perceived as new authorities with influence over forest management and that the monitors’ incentivized patrols were substitutes for traditional, unincentivized citizen patrols that suffer from free riding and inhibit timely community detection of and responses to deforestation. Our findings suggest that externally facilitated community-based monitoring protocols that combine remote-sensed early deforestation alerts with training and incentives for monitors could contribute to sustainable forest management.

We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C.

The bacterium Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague, and its genome has been sequenced from a variety of plague victims. However, the genomic diversity of Y. pestis has not been fully explored, and the evolutionary history of the pathogen is poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of Y. pestis genomes from the Neolithic and Bronze Age, revealing a single lineage of Y. pestis that persisted for millennia without significant diversification. This lineage was likely adapted to fleas, and its spread across Eurasia was facilitated by human migration.

The amorphous material is silica-rich, volatile-bearing, and has minor TiO2 and Fe2O3T oxides. The tridymite is a well-crystalline phase, consistent with high formation temperatures. The mudstone is probably detrital from silicic volcanism, and the amorphous material is probably derived from multiple infiltrations of aqueous solutions having variable compositions, temperatures, and acidities. The amorphous material is probably silica-rich opal-A and/or high-SiO2 glass, and the crystalline magnetite is probably a residue of acidic leaching in the sediment source region or at Marias Pass.

We use a trait-based approach to estimate the vulnerability of temperate and boreal forests to frost damage, and to forecast the future of frost damage under climate change. We find that the frequency of frost damage is increasing in the boreal zone, but decreasing in the temperate zone. We also find that the vulnerability of temperate forests to frost damage is increasing, whereas the vulnerability of boreal forests is decreasing. Our findings reveal region-specific changes in the spring-frost risk that can inform decision-making in land management, forestry, agriculture, and insurance policy.

The discovery of Jinguofortis perplexus, a basal pygostylian from the Early Cretaceous of China, adds to our understanding of the mosaic evolution of the earliest birds. Jinguofortis preserves a mosaic combination of plesiomorphic nonavian theropod features such as a fused scapulocoracoid (a major component of the flight apparatus) and more derived flight-related morphologies including the earliest evidence of reduction in manual digits among birds. The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in adult individuals independently evolved in Jinguofortisidae and Confuciusornithiformes may relate to an accelerated osteogenesis during chondrogenesis and likely formed through the heterochronic process of peramorphosis by which these basal taxa retain the scapulocoracoid of the nonavian theropod ancestors with the addition of flight-related modifications. With wings having a low aspect ratio and wing loading, Jinguofortis may have been adapted particularly to dense forest environments. The discovery of Jinguofort"

The symbionts are essential for the squid’s bioluminescence, and the squid provides the symbionts with a safe haven and a steady supply of nutrients. However, the details of the symbiosis are not fully understood. Here, we show that the squid’s immune cells, the hemocytes, are responsible for the provision of the symbionts with the nutrient chitin. We also show that the symbionts are able to metabolize chitin only at night, when the hemocytes are active. Finally, we show that the symbionts are able to produce bioluminescence only when they are provided with chitin. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the symbiosis and suggest that the symbionts may be able to survive in the wild only if they are provided with a steady supply of chitin.

The survey is a valuable source of information for farmers, agribusinesses, and the public. However, the survey is not without its limitations.

Instead, we show that the brain can store information in the form of a dynamic variable that is read back into the active state of the neuron. This mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order, and it enables the binding of linguistic features over time within dynamic memory registers. This work provides a step toward a computational neurobiology of language.

However, the response of soil respiration to climate change remains poorly understood. We synthesize the largest dataset to date of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements, totaling &gt;3,800 observations representing 27 temperature manipulation studies, spanning nine biomes and over 2 decades of warming. Our analysis reveals no significant differences in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes, with the exception of deserts and boreal forests. Thus, our data provide limited evidence of acclimation of soil respiration to experimental warming in several major biome types, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Moreover, across all nondesert biomes, respiration rates with and without experimental warming follow a Gaussian response, increasing with soil temperature up to a threshold of ∼25 °C, above which respiration rates decrease with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions."

We identified a potent immunosuppressant protein, MTX, in the submandibular salivary gland of the vampiric bat, Myotis pilosus. MTX inhibited the antiviral responses of the host and facilitated viral infection. We found that MTX inhibited the proinflammatory proteases (i.e., plasmin, trypsin, and elastase) to induce immune tolerance and maintain high stability. In mouse models, influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 infection and pathogenicity were exacerbated by MTX but were reversed by interfering with the effects of MTX on LTA4H or exogenous LTB4 administration. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX.

The mechanistic details of enzyme catalysis are often revealed by the application of NMR-assisted crystallography, which provides atomic-resolution characterization of the enzyme active site and its substrate. Here, we apply this approach to the tryptophan synthase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of tryptophan, an essential amino acid. The enzyme catalyzes the β-elimination and replacement of a hydroxyl group from the α-amino group of L-tryptophan to form the α-aminoacrylate intermediate. The NMR-assisted crystallography reveals the location and orientation of the crystallographic water in the active site, which serves as a hydrogen bond donor to the ε-amino group of the acid–base catalytic residue βLys87. The NMR-assisted crystallography also reveals the location of the benzimidazole substrate in the active site, which is poised for, but unable to initiate, the subsequent bond formation step. The mechanistic details of the reaction are revealed by modeling the benzimidazole"

The symbionts are essential for the squid’s bioluminescence, and the squid provides the symbionts with a safe haven and a steady supply of nutrients. However, the details of the symbiosis are not well understood. Here, we show that the squid’s immune cells, the hemocytes, are the primary source of the chitin that the symbionts use to produce bioluminescence. We also show that the symbionts are able to metabolize the chitin only at night, when the hemocytes are active. Finally, we show that the symbionts are able to produce bioluminescence only when the hemocytes are active. Our results suggest that the squid’s immune cells are able to regulate the activities of the symbionts through the provision of specific nutrients.

The virus has been shown to be transmitted by respiratory droplets, and the most common symptoms are fever, cough, and fatigue. However, the molecular basis for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is not fully understood. Here, we report the discovery of a new family of SARS-CoV-2-specific proteins, which we call the SARS-CoV-2-specific accessory proteins (SARS-CoV-2-APs). We show that SARS-CoV-2-APs are involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. We also show that SARS-CoV-2-APs are involved in the pathogenesis of other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1.

The virus is a member of the family Orthomyxoviridae, which is divided into two genera, A and B. Influenza A viruses are further divided into subtypes, which are distinguished by the presence or absence of two hemagglutinin (HA) and two neuraminidase (NA) proteins. The HA proteins are the primary targets of the immune system, and the NA proteins are the primary targets of antiviral drugs. The HA proteins are further divided into two subtypes, H1 and H3, and the NA proteins are further divided into two subtypes, N1 and N2. The HA and NA proteins are encoded by eight segments of the viral genome, which are packaged into a single viral particle. The HA and NA proteins are packaged into the viral particle in a sequence-dependent manner. The HA and NA proteins interact with each other to form a supramolecular network that is required for the assembly of the viral particle. We identified a sequence-dependent interaction between the HA and NA proteins that is not widely conserved among influenza A viruses. This interaction is required for the selective packaging"

We use a mathematical model to estimate the within-host dynamics of ZIKV in a macaque model. We find that the median time to viral production is ∼4 h, the median within-host basic reproductive number is 10.7, and the lifetime of an infected cell while producing virus is ∼5 h. We also estimate that the minimum number of virions produced by an infected cell over its lifetime is ∼5,500. We assess the potential effect of an antiviral treatment that blocks viral replication, showing that the median time to undetectable plasma viral load (VL) can be reduced from ∼5 d to ∼3 d with a drug concentration ∼15 times the drug’s EC50 when treatment is given prophylactically starting at the time of infection. In the case of favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor with activity against ZIKV, we predict a dose of 150 mg/kg given twice a day initiated at the time of infection can reduce the peak median VL by ∼3 logs and shorten the time to undetectable median V"

Here, we show that the metabolic energy demand of the coral host is a key factor in the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis. We show that the metabolic energy demand of the coral host is increased by heat stress, which is compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promotes the growth of algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. Together, these processes form a feedback loop that will gradually lead to the decoupling of carbon translocation from the symbiont to the host. Energy limitation and altered symbiotic nutrient cycling are thus key factors in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis.

Herein, aqueous Li-ion batteries are proposed for high-energy applications. The proposed negative electrode material, LixNb2/7Mo3/7O2, delivers a large capacity of ∼170 mA ⋅ h ⋅ g−1 with a low operating potential range of 1.9 to 2.8 versus Li/Li+ in 21 m lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (LiTFSA) aqueous electrolyte. A full cell consisting of Li1.05Mn1.95O4/Li9/7Nb2/7Mo3/7O2 presents high energy density of 107 W ⋅ h ⋅ kg−1 as the maximum value in 21 m LiTFSA aqueous electrolyte, and 73% in capacity retention is achieved after 2,000 cycles. Furthermore, hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy study reveals that a protective surface layer is formed at the surface of the negative electrode, by which the high-energy and durable aqueous batteries are realized with L"

We further confirm that the internalization efficiency of DNA nanostructures correlates with their respective gene silencing efficiencies but that the endogenous gene silencing pathway depends on the siRNA attachment locus. Our work establishes the feasibility of biomolecule delivery to plants with DNA nanostructures and both details the design parameters of importance for plant cell internalization and also assesses the impact of DNA nanostructure geometry for gene silencing mechanisms.

We find that small tributaries contribute a disproportionate amount of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus to Lake Michigan, and that their nutrient loads are highly bioavailable. This finding suggests that small tributaries may be a major driver of coastal eutrophication in large water bodies.

However, certification has not reduced tropical deforestation. We use a comprehensive dataset of RSPO-certified and noncertified oil palm plantations in Indonesia to evaluate the impact of certification on deforestation and fire. Certification lowered deforestation by 33% from a counterfactual of 9.8 to 6.6% y−1. Nevertheless, most plantations contained little residual forest when they received certification. As a result, by 2015, certified areas held less than 1% of forests remaining within Indonesian oil palm plantations. Moreover, certification had no causal impact on forest loss in peatlands or active fire detection rates. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.

We present the first evidence for the presence of this feature in a fossil hand from the Middle Pleistocene, 1.42 Mya, in the fossil record. This fossil is from the Kaitio Formation of Kenya, where the earliest known Homo erectus fossils are found. The presence of this feature in the fossil hand suggests that the distinctive complex of radial carpometacarpal joint features in the human hand arose early in the evolution of the genus Homo and probably in Homo erectus sensu lato.
