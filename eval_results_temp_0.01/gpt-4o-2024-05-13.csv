They used a big machine to look at it very closely under high pressure and cold temperatures. This is the first time they saw neon gas trapped in ice like this. The neon atoms can move around inside the ice because they are not stuck to anything. Computer simulations show that this ice is stable at very high pressure and cold temperatures. The neon atoms mostly move sideways inside the ice, and their movement is limited by other neon atoms nearby."

They need both invertebrates and vertebrates to live. Scientists think they are related to cnidarians like jellyfish and corals because their polar capsule looks like the stinging parts of cnidarians. To learn more, scientists studied the DNA of two Myxozoa species and compared them to a cnidarian parasite called Polypodium hydriforme. They found out that Myxozoa are a type of cnidarian and are closely related to P. hydriforme. Myxozoa have very small genomes with fewer genes, especially those needed for development and cell communication. This shows that as Myxozoa evolved from free-living cnidarians to parasites, their genomes and body plans became much simpler."

Viruses often stop the body's defenses to make more copies of themselves. In this study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 can block certain proteins in the body to stop them from fighting the virus. A part of the virus called Orf6 does this job. Orf6 goes to a part of the cell called the nuclear pore complex and attaches to other proteins there to stop important work from happening. If Orf6 is changed in a small way, it can't attach and do its job. This shows how the virus uses the body's own parts to stop it from fighting back."

In this study, we used a special method to find out how. We discovered that Zn2+ binds to Hv1 and stops it from opening. Changing parts of Hv1 can affect how Zn2+ works. These changes are the same in both single and double Hv1 channels. We think Zn2+ has two effects: at low levels, it stops the channel from opening; at high levels, it also stops the channel's voltage sensor from moving. Learning how Zn2+ stops Hv1 can help us understand Hv1 better and might help make new medicines."

Studies show that when temperatures get too high, crop yields go down and become more unpredictable. We used data on maize (corn) production and climate to see how yields will change with 2 °C and 4 °C more global warming. We found that maize yields will become more variable and lower almost everywhere. For the top four maize-exporting countries, the chance of losing more than 10% of their maize in any year is almost zero now. But this chance goes up to 7% with 2 °C warming and 86% with 4 °C warming. This means global grain trade and prices will be less stable, hurting the 800 million poorest people the most.

Scientists have studied how big plant-eating animals, like zebras and antelopes, share food. They eat different kinds of plants and parts of plants at different times and places. But it's hard to know exactly what each animal eats because old methods are not detailed enough. We used a new method called DNA metabarcoding to find out what seven types of animals in Africa eat. These animals eat mostly grass or leaves. Zebras eat almost only grass, while dik-diks eat almost only leaves. The new method showed that animals of similar sizes and diets shared more foods. However, even similar animals ate different things. This means that it's important to look closely at what each animal eats to understand how they live together.

Second, businesses that thought the crisis would last a long time were more likely to close. Third, many small businesses didn't have much money saved. Most had only enough cash to last two weeks. Fourth, most businesses planned to get help from the CARES Act, but they expected it to be hard to qualify and get the money. We also looked at how businesses reacted to loans versus grants."

Another protein, SCD1, works with SREBP1 to stop ferroptosis by making certain fats. Removing SREBP1 or SCD1 makes cancer cells more sensitive to ferroptosis. Adding SREBP1 or SCD1 back makes them resist ferroptosis again. In mouse models of breast and prostate cancer, blocking mTORC1 and inducing ferroptosis shrank the tumors a lot.

We thought birds that live in older forests would do better on federal land but not as well on private land where clearcutting continued. We also thought birds that like open areas would decrease on federal land because there was less human disturbance. Our study found that bird populations changed with the forest. Surprisingly, birds in older forests declined faster than we expected because of fires and ongoing clearcutting. The plan knew it would take time to help older forests recover. While open areas stayed mostly the same, they did decrease in some regions, along with the birds that live there. Even though the NWFP stopped clearcutting on federal land, it hasn't been enough to help birds in older forests.

We tested these new antibiotics in the lab and on resistant bacteria to see how effective they are. Our best candidate is easier to make, dissolves better, and works 56 times better than an old drug called telithromycin. It works well against tough bacteria like Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli, especially when used with another drug called colistin."

New designs of these networks add extra steps to work better. They often need many settings to get good results. We made a new network that uses special convolutions to see images in different ways and connect all parts together. This new design gets good results with fewer settings. It's also easier to use and works well for many tasks. We tested it and found it can solve problems well with less chance of mistakes.

We studied water changes in Lake Malawi, East Africa, using data from drilling. Over time, we saw big changes in how much water was in the lake. There were 24 times when the lake level dropped by more than 200 meters, and 15 times it dropped more than 400 meters. About 800,000 years ago, there was a big climate change. Before this, the lake was lower and the climate was drier with many changes. After this, the lake was often full but had times of extreme drought. These changes affected fish in the lake, helping new species form."

A survey of 1,508 adults in the USA showed that 90% use electronics at least a few nights a week within an hour before bed. Studies from around the world show that using electronics before bed can harm sleep. This is because the light from these devices makes people more awake, lowers melatonin (a sleep hormone), and changes the body's sleep clock. Some studies show these devices lower melatonin, but we don't know much about how they affect the sleep cycle. In this study, we looked at the effects of reading an electronic book (eBook) versus a printed book before bed. People who read an eBook took longer to fall asleep, felt less sleepy in the evening, had lower melatonin, a delayed sleep clock, and felt less alert in the morning compared to when they read a printed book. This shows that using eBooks before bed can delay sleep, lower melatonin, and affect sleep and health."

But the materials from Belgium and Pennsylvania had different osmium, suggesting they mixed with stuff from space. However, the amounts in Belgium were too low to be from a meteorite. In Pennsylvania, they found small spheres with minerals that form at very high temperatures, like from a space rock impact. The spheres had low osmium ratios but likely came from Earth.

Some beetles got special plant-eating genes from bacteria and fungi, which helped them eat tough plant parts. This likely led to the rise of many new beetle species. These genes allowed beetles to eat leaves, stems, and wood in new ways. Beetles became so diverse because of these new eating habits, long lives, and evolving with flowering plants."

APOE is important for Alzheimer's disease, but we don't know exactly how it changes the risk. We found that certain brain cells called astrocytes, which make APOE, help clean up old connections in the brain. APOE helps astrocytes do this cleaning. APOE2 helps them clean better, while APOE4 makes them clean worse. We also found that a protein called C1q builds up more in brains with APOE4 and less with APOE2. This C1q buildup might lead to brain cell damage. So, APOE might change how well astrocytes clean the brain, which could affect the chances of getting Alzheimer's disease."

This means the inner core likely formed in two steps, with bcc iron forming first. This helps solve the inner core nucleation paradox and helps us understand more about the inner core's structure."

Now, they are finding that mRNAs, which tell cells how to make proteins, can also be changed after they are made. These changes can affect how stable the mRNA is, how it attracts proteins, and how it is translated into proteins. We studied a common change in mRNAs called pseudouridine (Ψ) using a bacterial system and human cells. We found that replacing one part of the mRNA with Ψ can slow down protein-making and affect other steps in the process. A detailed look at a ribosome, the cell's protein factory, supports this. Ψ can also cause cells to make different protein pieces from the same mRNA and speed up some reactions. Most Ψ is found in the parts of mRNA that code for proteins. Our study shows that Ψ can change how fast and accurately proteins are made."

They also have less pain, are stronger, walk faster, are less likely to be overweight, and have better health markers. They live healthier lives by being active, eating well, sleeping well, and not smoking.

They found that three out of four water mammal groups are moving towards a size of around 500 kg. This size may be best for living in water. The study suggests that water mammals need to be a certain size to stay warm and eat well. So, living in water makes these mammals grow bigger."

Scientists studied how this happens by looking at mouse airway cells infected with the virus at both temperatures. They found that at 37 °C, the cells made more antiviral defense genes. These genes help fight the virus. This strong response at 37 °C was linked to higher levels of certain proteins called IFNs. These proteins are important for fighting infections. The MAVS protein was crucial for this process. When scientists added a fake virus signal, the cells made more IFNs at 37 °C than at 33 °C. If the cells lacked MAVS or IFN receptors, the virus grew more, especially at 37 °C. This study shows that the cold virus grows better in the nose because the cells' defense is weaker at cooler temperatures."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa can feel when it touches surfaces using tiny hair-like structures called type IV pili. These pili stick to the surface and then pull back, sending signals inside the bacteria. This process helps the bacteria produce molecules that control many genes, including those that make it more harmful. When the pili sense the surface, they become more active, helping the bacteria attach more strongly and form protective layers called biofilms. The pili interact with a sensor protein called PilJ. This shows that Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses its pili to move and to sense surfaces, which helps it become more dangerous."

Most hydropower dams were built in North America and Europe between 1920 and 1970. They stopped building big dams because the best spots were used up, and it became too expensive due to environmental and social issues. Now, more dams are being taken down in North America and Europe than being built. The hydropower industry started building dams in developing countries from the 1970s, especially in places like the Mekong, Amazon, and Congo River Basins. These dams cause problems like hurting river life, cutting down forests, losing animal species, releasing greenhouse gases, displacing people, and changing how people live and farm. This paper looks at the spread of large dams in developing countries and the need to think about climate change when building dams. It also talks about the problems with how benefits are overestimated and costs are underestimated.

But inflammation also happens in animal models of AD without these plaques, making scientists wonder what causes it early on. We think this inflammation comes from brain cells filled with toxic Aβ particles. In rats with early signs of AD, these brain cells made strong immune signals, even without plaques or cell death. These signals matched the activity of other brain cells. We saw a special type of inflammation in these Aβ-filled brain cells, but not in nearby cells. In human brains, this brain cell-specific inflammation might happen before plaques form. So, Aβ-filled brain cells may start inflammation in AD, making the buildup of Aβ inside cells an important part of the disease."

A study in Beijing showed the tool is very useful. We found that as aerosols increased, there were more cloud droplets, but they were smaller. However, this did not change the total amount of water in the cloud. This supports the idea that more aerosols can stop rain from forming but also make more water evaporate. These observations from the dual-FOV HSRL help us better understand ACI and represent a big step forward."

K+ channels usually have two gates: one inside for quick action and another at the filter for slow action. BK channels do not have the usual gate inside and do not show slow action. We thought the BK channel's gate might be near the filter. We tested this by changing some parts of the BK channel and saw it had slow action when there was very little K+. This slow action happened when the cell was less active and stopped when the cell was more active. We found that BK channels act differently from other K+ channels. This slow action happens when the channel is closed and is linked to how often the channel opens. We think the BK channel's normal closing is the first step of slow action.

Breathing dry air makes it harder for mice to clear the virus, fight it, and heal. Mice without certain genes did better in dry air, even though they had the same amount of virus. Dry air also made it harder for lung cells to fight the virus. This shows that dry air weakens the body's defense against the flu and makes it harder to heal."

We studied brain activity in people while they read sentences and lists of words. We found that certain brain areas became more active with each word in a sentence. But when words could be grouped into a phrase, the activity suddenly dropped. This suggests the brain combines words into phrases. Some simpler models that look at word sequences didn't match the brain activity well. Our study showed that combining words into phrases fits better with how the brain works. This supports the idea that the brain forms sentences using a tree-like structure."

Our study shows the program helped reduce tree loss, but the exact amount is unclear. In the first year, tree loss went down by 8.4 hectares per community, and in the second year, by 3.3 hectares. The biggest reductions were in the most threatened areas. People in the communities thought the program's monitors became new leaders who helped manage the forest better.

This study shows that the orb-weaving spider, Larinioides sclopetarius, hears using its web. The spider's web is like a super hearing device that catches sound better than any known eardrum. By feeling the web's vibrations, the spider can tell where sounds are coming from, like prey or predators. The web helps the spider hear better because it's much bigger than the spider's body and can be fixed or changed as needed. This unique way of hearing can help us learn more about sensing and create new sound detectors."

This was true even when considering their political party, gender, race, and education. People who believed in this type of masculinity also trusted the government less, were more sexist, racist, and xenophobic, but still supported Trump.

When A. fumigatus was grown with other harmful fungi and bacteria, the chemicals stopped them from growing by using copper. This included stopping a key enzyme in some microbes. Adding copper to bacteria treated with xanthocillin helped them grow again, proving these chemicals grab copper. The presence of these genes in other fungi suggests they also use them to manage copper and fight other microbes."

These frosts are important for farming and forests, but we don't know a lot about where they happen or how they affect evolution. We studied LSFs from 1959 to 2017 and looked at how trees in the Northern Hemisphere protect their leaves from frost. We used data from up to 1,500 types of trees grown in similar conditions. We found that places like eastern North America, where LSFs are common, have trees that leaf out late to avoid frost. In places like Europe and Asia, where LSFs were rare, trees leaf out quickly when it gets warm. Now, LSFs are happening more often in Europe and Asia. We think about 35% of European and 26% of Asian forests will have more frost damage, but only about 10% of North American forests will. Our study helps understand how spring frosts are changing and can help with decisions in farming, forestry, and insurance."

We think these expert surveys are very good at showing how crops are doing. This is because many experts from all over the country check the crops and share their knowledge. We looked at data from the USDA surveys from 1987 to 2019 for four main crops in the US. We showed how to turn the survey data into numbers that are easy to analyze. Even though the surveys are based on what different people see, the data is reliable and works well across different crops and places.

Usually, people think this happens with brain cells staying active. But some think it happens through quick changes in brain cell connections. We suggest memory works by making brain cells less active over time. Each brain cell's activity changes based on what it experiences. Our tests show these changes help memory from milliseconds to seconds. Brain cell spikes write info into slower-changing variables. This info is then read back into active brain states. This memory doesn't need constant activity or special connections. Instead, info stays in changing conductances that lower activity and can be used anytime. Memory length depends on how fast these changes happen and brain cell activity levels. Memory problems happen when changes last too long. This memory method works well for understanding language over time and connecting language parts. Our work helps understand how the brain processes language."

These pigments help in photosynthesis by capturing sunlight and turning it into energy. (Bacterio)chlorophylls have a special fifth ring that took more than 60 years to understand. Two different enzymes help make this ring. Most bacteria use an enzyme called BchE, which is sensitive to oxygen. Plants and some bacteria use another enzyme called AcsF, which needs oxygen to work. Mutants in plants and cyanobacteria show problems in using AcsF, leading to the build-up of its starting material. Swapping these enzymes between different organisms shows that there are three types of AcsF. A specific type from a bacterium called Rubrivivax (Rvi.) gelatinosus can replace its counterpart in cyanobacteria and even works without a helper protein. But to replace AcsF in Rvi. gelatinosus, both the cyanobacterial enzyme and its helper are needed. This shows that Ycf54 is a part of the enzyme in oxygen-using organisms and that there are different classes of the enzyme based on their need for helpers. AcsF works in Rvi. gelatinosus, while other bacteria need a new protein called BciE. These findings explain the three types of O2-dependent enzymes in plants and bacteria and how they evolved."

This study looked at how giving a single type of glycan from the host helps keep the balance between the squid Euprymna scolopes and its glowing partner, Vibrio fischeri. V. fischeri lives in special parts of the squid where it helps produce light. The squid makes a type of glycan called chitin in its immune cells. Just before night, these cells move to the special parts and release chitin. This happens only when the partnership is mature. Both the squid and the bacteria show that chitin is given and used only at night. A V. fischeri that couldn't break down chitin could still live normally until the squid organ matured, showing chitin is important for the bacteria to stay. Breaking down chitin also makes the special parts more acidic at night, giving bacteria more oxygen to make light. We think other animals might also manage their microbes by giving them special nutrients that change conditions like pH or oxygen levels."

We found that the enzyme stops at different points for the three damages. One type of damage makes the enzyme stop more when another protein helps fix mistakes. We learned that the enzyme uses different methods to get past each type of damage. For one type, it mostly fixes the damage without mistakes. For another type, it often makes errors. For the third type, it uses many ways to get past the damage. Our lab tests matched what happens in living cells. We also found a part of the enzyme that helps it move along damaged DNA.

Scientists wanted to understand how these cuts help the virus infect cells. They changed the virus so the first cut couldn't happen. This made it hard for the virus to infect lung cells but didn't affect other types of cells much. The cuts help the virus change shape so it can enter the cells.

In this study, scientists found that two RNA parts of an avian (bird) flu virus stick together. They showed this happens in infected cells and is needed for the virus to replicate well. Breaking this interaction did not change the number of virus particles made, but it did reduce how much viral RNA was in them, leading to more empty virus particles. Experiments showed that this interaction helps package the RNA parts together.

Aqueous Li-ion batteries are being studied for this. But, aqueous electrolytes have a small stable range, which limits energy and material choices for the negative electrode. To make long-lasting and high-energy aqueous Li-ion batteries, we need negative electrodes that have high capacity and low potential without breaking down water. A new negative electrode material called LixNb2/7Mo3/7O2 has been suggested. It gives a large capacity and works in a low potential range. A battery with this material and Li1.05Mn1.95O4 showed high energy density and kept 73% of its capacity after 2,000 cycles. Studies showed that a protective layer forms on the negative electrode, which helps the battery last longer. This work shows a way to combine high capacity with safe materials using a special Mo-based oxide."

In adult mammals, neurons can't grow back well if they get hurt. We found a new way neurons can grow back that doesn't need certain usual signals. In tiny worms called C. elegans, this new growth is linked to another known way neurons grow. Both types of growth happen when a neuron gets damaged or when certain genes change. This new growth might help us find new genes that help neurons heal. We saw that this new growth in worms is like a strong healing response in mammal neurons when they get hurt. Both types of growth happen when neuron activity goes down and are helped by changes in calcium signals or other molecules. Our study helps us understand how neurons can heal themselves."

In humans and mice, they are found where a special protein binds. To study recombination in a plant called monkeyflower, scientists looked at the DNA of many wild plants. They found over 400,000 places where recombination happened. There are about 13,000 hotspots mixed with cold regions. Recombination happens more near the start of genes and less inside them. This pattern is similar to what is seen in yeast and in special mice without the protein. This suggests that these recombination patterns might be very old and common in many living things."

Scientists also looked at brain activity when people were doing tasks. They saw that healthy people and early PD patients had a certain brain network turn off during tasks, but this turning off was less in people with advanced PD. Medicine helped fix this a bit. They also studied how this brain network changes over time in PD and Alzheimer's disease.

A special EXO70 protein can resist ES2, showing it has different important parts. This research helps us understand exocytosis and may lead to new treatments for human diseases."

Some animals use many genes to decide sex, which can create more than two sexes. We studied a fish called Metriaclima mbenjii that has four sex types: ZZXX females, ZWXX females, ZWXY females, and ZZXY males. These sex types affect their body shapes and behaviors. Adding new sex genes can change different body parts and behaviors even more. Unlike single-gene sex determination, this multi-gene way can create more variety in sexes. Understanding this helps us learn why and how sex genes change in populations."

We wanted to see how iron affects the eye, especially in cells that have a lot of vitamin A byproducts, which can create harmful chemicals. In mice given a medicine called deferiprone (DFP) that removes iron, iron levels went down. These mice had higher levels of vitamin A byproducts. The outer part of their eye cells was less damaged. Mice with more iron in their eye cells had lower levels of these byproducts. This shows that iron helps break down the vitamin A byproducts. DFP also stopped the breakdown of vitamin A byproducts in light and reduced cell death in tests. Iron can also break down these byproducts without light, showing its strong effect."

They looked at 45 species and measured 29 features of their tentacles. They found that these predators can change from eating one type of prey to another by changing their tentacles. This shows that specialization in predators is not a dead end and helps us understand how different predators evolve to catch their food."

But we still have big questions about how human hands evolved. This is because we don't have many hand fossils from a certain time long ago. During this time, humans started making special stone tools. Modern humans and those from the Middle to Late Pleistocene have special features in their thumbs and wrists that early humans didn't have. We found a hand bone from an early human in Kenya that shows one of these features existed 1.42 million years ago. This tells us that the special features in human hands started to appear early in human evolution, probably in Homo erectus."

Folate helps cells grow. Mammals have SHMT1 in the cell fluid and SHMT2 in the mitochondria. SHMT2 is very active in cancer. We found that removing both SHMT1 and SHMT2 stops colon cancer tumors in mice. We made a chemical that stops both SHMT1 and SHMT2. This chemical works well in cells. Cancer tests showed that B-cell lines are very sensitive to SHMT being blocked. Adding formate usually helps cells survive SHMT being blocked, but it makes a certain type of B-cell cancer, called DLBCL, more sensitive. DLBCL cells can't take in glycine well, so they need SHMT to get enough glycine. This makes DLBCL a target for SHMT blockers."

We forget that natural areas like forests can also help improve diets, especially in poor rural areas. This study looked at how cutting down forests in Tanzania from 2008 to 2013 affected what people eat. Using a special method, we found that when forests were cut down, people ate fewer fruits and vegetables, and got less vitamin A. On average, each person ate 14 grams less of fruits and vegetables per day, which is about 11% of their daily intake. However, when forests were broken into smaller pieces, people ate more fruits and vegetables and got more vitamin A. This study shows that cutting down forests hurts people's diets and suggests that protecting forests can help improve nutrition and meet other goals like conservation."

But these machines are heavy and can damage the soil under the surface. The top soil stays the same, but deeper soil gets pressed too much and can't stay healthy. We made a world map showing where this problem might happen based on machine use, tractor size, soil type, and weather. About 20% of farm land is at risk, which could hurt food production. Farm machines need to be designed better to protect the soil. Big harvesters today are almost as heavy as the biggest dinosaurs. We think that just like big dinosaurs, these heavy machines can harm the land. Dinosaurs might have followed set paths to avoid this, which is a lesson for us in how to protect the soil."
