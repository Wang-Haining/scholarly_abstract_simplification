Here, we report the synthesis of neon hydrate, in which neon atoms are enclathrated in the channels of ice II. This is the first observation of a noble gas hydrate to our knowledge. The guest Ne atoms have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. Molecular dynamics simulation confirms that the resolved structure where Ne atoms dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The results provide insights into the structure and dynamics of guest atoms in noble gas hydrate. The synthesis of Ne hydrate may have potential applications in heat storage and release."

They are usually introduced via a complex vector space with a scalar product. We show that this is not necessary: The axioms of Hilbert spaces can be reformulated purely categorically, without using complex numbers or scalar products. This has the advantage that the axioms are much simpler and also that they apply to more general structures that might be of interest in quantum foundations. Our work is also significant for computer science, where categorical quantum mechanics is used to model quantum computation. Our categorical formulation is more concise and has a different emphasis compared to the existing analytical formulations. It also provides a different perspective on the relation between quantum mechanics and classical probability theory."

The origin of myxozoans has been a mystery, but a close relationship with the Cnidaria, a phylum that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids, is supported by some phylogenetic studies and the observation that the myxozoan polar capsule is similar to the stinging structures of cnidarians. We show that myxozoans are cnidarians, and a sister group to the more reduced parasite Polypodium hydriforme. Myxozoan genomes are extremely small, and gene ontology analyses indicate that categories related to development, cell differentiation, and cell–cell communication are depleted. These results suggest that the degeneration of the myxozoan body plan from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasite was accompanied by an extreme reduction in genome size and gene content."

Several viruses have evolved strategies to interfere with IFN signaling to establish infection. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 Orf6 targets the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to disrupt nuclear import and antagonize IFN signaling. This is an important finding because it demonstrates that a viral protein can alter NPC function to gain access to the nucleus and inhibit IFN signaling. This strategy may be used by other viruses that encode similar viral proteins. Therefore, understanding how viruses interfere with the IFN-signaling pathway and NPC function is critical for the development of strategies to combat viral infection. This is particularly relevant in the case of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2."

Zn2+ is an important physiological inhibitor of Hv1. In this study, we use the voltage clamp fluorometry technique to identify the molecular mechanism of Zn2+ inhibition of Hv1. We find that Zn2+ binds to both the activated closed and resting closed states of the Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. We propose that Zn2+ binding has two major effects on Hv1: (i) at low concentrations, Zn2+ binds to one site and prevents the opening conformational change of the pore of Hv1, thereby inhibiting proton conduction; and (ii) at high concentrations, Zn2+, in addition, binds to a second site and inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of how Zn2+ inhibits Hv1 will further our understanding of Hv1 function and might provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels.

Absent changes in temperature variability or breeding gains in heat tolerance, maize yield variability is projected to increase substantially in most maize-producing regions under 2 °C and 4 °C of global warming. This higher yield variability will lead to more frequent and severe maize production losses in the top four maize-exporting countries, which account for 87% of global maize exports. Presently, the probability that these countries have simultaneous production losses in any given year is virtually zero. Under 4 °C warming, this probability increases to 86%.

However, because comprehensive diet analysis is difficult, it is not known how many species-level plant taxa are consumed by different LMH species, or how this varies across species that differ in feeding strategy and body size. We used DNA metabarcoding to analyze 37,782 sequences from 1,032 fresh dung samples to quantify the breadth and overlap of diets for seven abundant African LMH species. Our results show that even sympatric species that are similar in feeding strategy and body size have highly distinct diets, which are underpinned by fine-grained partitioning of plant species.

However, the global load of plastic on the open ocean surface is far less than expected.

Alongside an expansion of the fleets, the effective catch per unit of effort has consistently decreased, showing the increasing pressure of fisheries on ocean resources. The effective catch per unit of effort of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance.

This is achieved by reduced expression of the transcriptional repressor BCL11A. These results suggest a mechanism for chronoregulation of fetal and adult hemoglobin expression in humans. These results have implications for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell disease."

It is regulated by many signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which is frequently mutated or hyperactivated in human cancer. Here we show that activation of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling confers resistance to ferroptosis. Mechanistically, this resistance requires sustained activation of mTORC1 and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1-dependent induction of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a central transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism. We also show that SREBP1-mediated induction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) is required for ferroptosis resistance. SCD1 produces monounsaturated fatty acids, which are essential for maintaining the integrity of the cell membrane during ferroptosis. Finally, we show that combination of mTORC1 inhibition with ferroptosis induction shows therapeutic promise in preclinical models of PI3K-mutated breast cancer and PTEN-defective prostate cancer."

Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo remodeling in hypertension, characterized by changes in gene expression and Ca2+ signaling machinery. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is activated in VSMCs in hypertension and promotes fibro-proliferative gene programs. Here, we show that three major classes of Ca2+ channel blockers for hypertension act on the endoplasmic reticulum stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) proteins to activate SOCE. This causes VSMC remodeling in vitro and in vivo. We also show that patients with cardiovascular disease treated with these blockers have higher risk of heart failure. Our findings suggest that these drugs should be used with caution in patients with advanced hypertension. We suggest that STIM/ORAI may be a target for drugs to treat hypertension and heart failure."

Although the NWFP stabilized the area of early-seral ecosystems on federal land, this was not the case in two ecoregions, where declines in early-seral bird populations continued. These findings suggest that the NWFP has not yet halted declines of older forests or reversed declines of early-seral ecosystems. Continued prioritization of older forests and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure are needed to reverse biodiversity declines."

Recently, the study of quantum quenches revealed that these concepts are intricately intertwined: although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure state maintains the system at zero entropy, local properties at long times are captured by a statistical ensemble with nonzero thermodynamic entropy, which is the entanglement accumulated during the dynamics. We show that the standard quasiparticle picture of the entanglement evolution, complemented with integrability-based knowledge of the steady state and its excitations, leads to a complete understanding of the entanglement dynamics in the space–time scaling limit. We thoroughly check our result for the paradigmatic Heisenberg chain.

Simplified version: The interplay between entanglement and thermodynamics is one of the most fascinating aspects of quantum many-body systems. Entanglement is a quantum feature that is not present in the classical world, while thermodynamics is the realm of large systems where the laws of physics are described by statistical mechanics. The fact that both concepts are intimately intertwined was unveiled only recently. In particular, it was shown that in a quantum many-body system evolving unitarily, although the state remains pure (zero entropy), the entanglement that develops locally has the statistical properties"

During the Second Pandemic (14th to 19th centuries), plague caused high mortality in Europe, including the Black Death (1346–1353), but the mechanisms behind the spread of the disease are not fully understood. Many studies suggest that human ectoparasites, such as body lice or human fleas, were responsible for the rapidly developing epidemics, but there is little supporting evidence. Here, we develop a mathematical model for plague transmission by human ectoparasites and show that it fits mortality data from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for rodent or respiratory transmission. This supports the hypothesis that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic."

However, how the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin severing mechanism adapts to the filament network context is unknown. We use microfluidics, single-molecule, and single-filament techniques to monitor and quantify ADF/cofilin’s action on isolated filaments and filament networks. We discover that ADF/cofilin binding and severing are strongly influenced by filament mechanical state. In particular, we demonstrate that ADF/cofilin binding induces a mechanical torque on filaments, which dramatically enhances severing. As a consequence, interconnected filament networks are severed by cofilin far more efficiently than nonconnected filaments. We propose that this mechanochemical mechanism is critical to boost ADF/cofilin’s severing ability in the complex and highly connected actin network of cells.

Recently, they have been shown to function as precursors to nucleoside tetraphosphate (Np4) RNA caps. Removal of this cap is critical for initiating 5′ end-dependent degradation of those RNAs. The predominant Np4 decapping enzyme in proteobacteria, ApaH, is inactivated by the very conditions of disulfide stress that enable Np4-capped RNAs to accumulate to high levels. Here, we show that the RNA pyrophosphohydrolase RppH assumes a leading role in decapping those transcripts in such conditions. Unexpectedly, this enzyme recognizes Np4-capped 5′ ends by a mechanism distinct from the one it uses to recognize other 5′ termini, resulting in a one-nucleotide shift in substrate specificity. This unconventional manner in which RppH recognizes Np4 caps and its differential impact on the rates at which such termini are deprotected could have major consequences for reprogramming gene expression during disulfide stress.

This correlation suggests that the BK channel’s normal closing may represent an early conformational stage of C-type inactivation. This is supported by the observation that the BK channel’s normal closing can be induced by hyperpolarized membrane potentials or decreased intracellular calcium, conditions that favor C-type inactivation. Thus, the BK channel’s activation gate may coexist with or be spatially overlapped by the C-type inactivation gate at or near the selectivity filter.

Here, we show that the spider outsources its auditory sensors to its extended phenotype, the proteinaceous, self-manufactured web, and supersizes its eardrum to 10,000 times the size of the spider itself. The web acts as an acoustic antenna to capture the sound-induced air particle movements approaching the"

This is a critical first step in the transmission of disease. This work also provides insight into the evolution of pathogen–vector interactions."

This discovery is important for understanding the origin and evolution of the modern avian bauplan, which is characterized by a number of novelties including a fused scapulocoracoid (shoulder girdle). The presence of a fused scapulocoracoid in basal birds is a major puzzle because it represents a major reversal to the nonavian theropod condition. Here, we provide a phylogenetic analysis and discuss the significance of this taxon for understanding mosaic evolution and adaptation to dense forest habitats in early birds. Jinguofortis also shows that reduction in manual digits (fingers) of birds occurred very early in the evolution of the modern avian bauplan."

We report here that exposure of breast cancer cells to hypoxia led to increased expression of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), an m6A demethylase, which demethylated NANOG mRNA, resulting in increased NANOG expression and the CSC phenotype. These changes were mediated by hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), HIF-1α and HIF-2α. ALKBH5 expression was also increased in primary breast tumors in association with increased NANOG expression and with HIF-1α or HIF-2α expression. Thus, HIF-dependent ALKBH5 expression mediates enrichment of CSCs in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Inhibitors of ALKBH5 activity may, therefore, be a useful adjuvant to radiotherapy for breast cancer patients."

We show that these adaptive changes in excitability provide memory on timescales ranging from milliseconds to seconds. On this account, spiking activity writes information into coupled dynamic variables that control adaptation and move at slower timescales than the membrane potential. Information is continuously read back into the active membrane state for processing. This mechanism is suitable for language.

We analyze the largest global dataset of soil respiration, moisture, and temperature measurements to date, totaling &gt;3,800 observations from 27 warming experiments spanning nine biomes. Our analysis reveals a Gaussian response in respiration rates with temperature, increasing up to a threshold of ∼25 °C and decreasing with further increases in temperature. This consistent decrease in temperature sensitivity at higher temperatures demonstrates that rising global temperatures may result in regionally variable responses in soil respiration, with colder climates being considerably more responsive to increased ambient temperatures compared with warmer regions. These findings have important implications for climate change mitigation."

The model is based on analyses of the evolution of the plastid genome of the parasitic plant Epifagus virginiana and its relatives. We show that relaxed purifying selection in all plastid genes is linked to obligate parasitism, characterized by the parasite’s dependence on a host to fulfill its life cycle, rather than the loss of photosynthesis. This model can be applied to other organelle genomes that have undergone major lifestyle changes."

The integrated structural information from NMR-assisted crystallography is used to understand why the enzyme substrate L-serine is replaced by the nonreactive analog benzimidazole in the active site, but unable to react further. This work is significant for mechanistic enzymology because it shows how NMR-assisted crystallography can be used to identify structure–reactivity relationships that are not easily accessible by other means. The α-aminoacrylate structure also provides a snapshot of the chemical reactivity of the enzyme in the transition state leading to the product L-tryptophan."

Acidification enhances the symbionts’ capacity to produce bioluminescence at night, which is important for the host’s communication with its predators and prey. This work suggests that the nutrient requirements of symbionts can be used by hosts to regulate the activity of their microbial communities, and that these communities can be fine-tuned to support host behaviors that occur on a daily cycle.

We determined that the first cleavages are required for MERS-CoV infection into human lung-derived cells, but are dispensable for infection into several other cell types. These cell type-specific requirements for proteolysis correlated with S conformations during cell entry.

The effects, except for the increased expression of CRF itself, could all be blocked by pretreatment with an antagonist of the CRF receptor CRFR1. We also show that CRF, acting through CRFR1, triggers signaling of cAMP/PKA, intracellular Ca2+, and PKCε in cultured primary astrocytes, and the up-regulated cAMP/PKA signaling contributes to the phosphorylation and expression of AQP4 to enhance water influx into astrocytes and produces an up-regulation of ET-1 expression. In conclusion, hypoxia triggers cortical release of CRF, which acts on CRFR1 to trigger signaling of cAMP/PKA in cortical astrocytes, leading to activation of AQP4 and cerebral edema. This study provides a better understanding of the pathophysiology of cerebral edema.

Using a mathematical model, we characterize the within-host dynamics of ZIKV infection in macaques. Our analysis of the available data suggests that the virus replicates rapidly, that a large number of virions are produced per infected cell, and that the eclipse phase is short. We also assess the impact of antiviral treatment on the course of infection, which can accelerate the loss of viral RNA from the plasma. Our results can be used to assess the impact of antiviral treatment on ZIKV infection. The data-fitting analysis approach can be applied to other viruses for which data are becoming available."

Mass bleaching events, in which the symbiotic algae are expelled from the coral, have become more frequent and severe. However, we still do not understand why bleaching occurs, which makes it difficult to predict the fate of coral reefs. Here, we show that heat stress causes a shift in the way nutrients are cycled within the coral–algal symbiosis, which gradually leads to a breakdown of the symbiosis. This is a major advance in our understanding of the causes of bleaching, and it may help to uncover fundamental processes underpinning the functioning of endosymbioses in general. This knowledge is essential to assess the vulnerability of coral reefs to climate change and to design effective strategies for their conservation."

In Drosophila, the epithelium regulates the absorption of nutrients, mounts immune responses, and prevents systemic infections. We show that in a Drosophila intestinal tumor model, tumors lead to aberrant activation of JNK signaling, followed by intestinal barrier dysfunction and commensal imbalance. In turn, the dysbiotic microbiome stimulates tumor growth. We find that inhibiting JNK signaling or depletion of the microbiome restores barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, leading to a reestablishment of host–microbe homeostasis. Our experiments identify a feedback amplification loop between intestinal tumors and the microbiome. They also highlight the importance of controlling the activity level of JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis. Similar mechanisms may be at play in mammalian systems.

These studies have important implications for understanding the etiology of cardiac arrhythmia."

Here, we show that Si enhances resistance to rice leaffolder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) in rice by activating jasmonate (JA)-induced defense responses. Transcripts encoding defense marker genes and activities of defense enzymes increased in Si-pretreated rice plants after leaffolder attack. Silencing of allene oxide synthase and CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1 genes resulted in reduced Si accumulation and Si cell expansion in leaves and reduced the beneficial effects of Si pretreatment on rice resistance to leaffolder larvae. These findings suggest that JA promotes Si accumulation and that Si activates JA-induced defense responses, leading to enhanced resistance to insect herbivores. This study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying Si-induced plant defense and the role of Si in the rhizosphere. The findings have implications for sustainable agriculture and environmental sustainability."

Here we show that it is essential for the activity of alkylglycerol monooxygenase, an enzyme that converts alkylglycerols to alkylglycerol-3-ols, which are further converted to alkylglycerol-3-phosphate and finally degraded to glycerone phosphate and the corresponding alcohol. We found intracellular alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity to be an important regulator of alkylglycerol metabolism in intact murine macrophages. The cellular lipidome was markedly changed in a parallel way by modulation of alkylglycerol monooxygenase expression and of tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis. Our results demonstrate a central role of tetrahydrobiopterin and alkylglycerol monooxygenase in ether lipid metabolism of murine macrophages. They reveal that alteration of alkylglycerol monooxygenase activity has a profound impact on the lipidome also beyond the class of ether lipids."

This is significant because DNA nanostructures are biocompatible, can be designed to be stable in biological media, and can be engineered to be internalized into plant cells. We show that the size, shape, and stiffness of the DNA nanostructure, as well as the location of the RNA cargo, can affect the internalization and gene silencing efficiency. This work establishes the feasibility of DNA nanostructures for plant cell delivery, which can be used to develop a new generation of plant transformation methods and can be extended to other biomolecules and other plants.

However, most monitoring and regulatory efforts focus on larger tributaries, largely ignoring the many small streams that drain directly into coastal waters. We show that small streams can have high nutrient loads, especially when compared to their size, and that these loads are highly enriched in forms of nitrogen and phosphorus that are most available to algae. These streams are likely to disproportionately contribute to nearshore eutrophication, an underappreciated threat to coastal ecosystems worldwide. Our findings suggest that expanding nutrient management efforts to include smaller watersheds could help mitigate the ecological impacts of nutrient loading on coastal ecosystems."

While certification lowered deforestation, it had no causal impact on peatland forest loss or fire occurrence. Moreover, most certification occurred in plantations with little remaining forest. Broader adoption of certification in forested regions, strict requirements to avoid all peat, and routine monitoring of clearly defined forest cover loss in certified and RSPO member-held plantations appear necessary if the RSPO is to yield conservation and climate benefits from reductions in tropical deforestation.
