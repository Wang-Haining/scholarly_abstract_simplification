The study demonstrates that Ne atoms can be used as a molecular probe to investigate the bonding in ice-like phases. The enclathration phenomenon not only provides a new route to host ice-X phases but also offers a new paradigm for understanding the bonding in hydrated systems with strong electron–electron interactions. These discoveries have also broad implications for understanding the bonding in other hydrated systems with strong electron–electron interactions. The study also provides a new perspective on the formation mechanism of ice-X phases. The guest Ne atoms occupy the centers of D2O channels and have substantial freedom of movement owing to the lack of direct bonding between guest molecules and host lattices. Molecular dynamics simulation confirms that the resolved structure where Ne dissolved in ice II is thermodynamically stable at 480 MPa and 260 K. The density distributions indicate that the vibration of Ne atoms is mainly in planes perpendicular to D2O channels, whereas their"

This paper provides a categorical definition of a linear function between Hilbert spaces, a structure defined with respect to a particular operator architecture. The axioms are purely categorical and do not presuppose any analytical structure. The method is similar to that of von Neumann in his reconstruction of quantum theory from his theory of probability. The axioms are general enough to show that any Hilbert space operator can be expressed as the limit of finite series in a suitable operator building block. This block consists of continuous linear functions from a compact space into a Hilbert space. The axioms are also specific enough to show that any Hilbert space operator can be expressed as the limit of finite series in a suitable operator building block. This block consists of Hilbert spaces and finite series in a suitable basis. The operator architecture is that of quantum theory. The axioms are constructive and yield a precise notion of equivalence. They are also consistent with the principle that “nothing is impossible.” They provide a mathematical foundation for the reconstruction of von Neumann’s theory.

Although the evolutionary origin of myxozoa is not understood, a close relationship between myxozoans and cnidarians, including the stinging structures (polar capsules) similar to nematocysts, is supported by phylogenetic and morphological analyses. To gain insight into the extreme reduction in genome size and gene content, we compared genomes of two distantly related myxozoans: the cnidarian parasite Polypodium hydriforme and the myxozoan parasite Kudoa iwatai. Our results suggest that myxozoans are cnidarians and are a sister taxon to P. hydriforme. We show that the extreme genome and gene content of myxozoans is unique and may reflect an extreme evolutionary transition from a free-living cnidarian to a microscopic parasite.

We find that Zn2+ binds to two different sites within each subunit of the dimeric Hv1 channel, thereby inhibiting both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. We also propose that Zn2+ binds to a second site and also inhibits the outward movement of the voltage sensor of Hv1. This work will provide valuable information for future drug development for Hv1 channels. We found that Zn2+ binds to residues that are important for both voltage sensor motion and gate opening. These residues include Phe, Tyr, and His, which are located in the same subunit as the Zn2+ binding site.

Meeting this demand while maintaining current climate conditions will prove challenging. Here, we show that, under global warming, maize yields will increasingly be volatile under conditions of strong climate variability, even if breeding for improved heat tolerance remains unchanged. If current trends continue, the probability that a year with production losses greater than 10% is simultaneously experienced by more than a quarter of the population will rise from negligible values to 86% under 2 °C of warming and to 7% under 4 °C of warming. This, in turn, will increase the probability that the probability that the probability that a year with negative yields occurs is high, thereby increasing the probability that the year sees a food price above USD 10 000/m3. We conclude that to avoid food instability, breeding programs that focus on increasing heat tolerance should be intensified as soon as possible. This will require more investments in breeding for heat tolerance, together with a clear strategy for their global implementation. We also recommend that national governments, international"

However, the extent to which they partition resources is largely unknown because of the lack of comprehensive species-level dietary data. We show that grass consumption is highly correlated with isotopic estimates of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative information about consumption. Dietary partitioning among large herbivores, even pairs of grazers, was often greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such coarse trophic categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and coexistence in LMH assemblages, and suggest that diversity of large herbivores may be more tightly linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized. This is one of few quantitative studies that quantifies the extent to which large herbivores partition food-plant species. Our results suggest that LMH assemblages may be more diverse than currently recognized and that future research should seek to understand how niche partitioning varies with plant diversity.

We show that plastic fragments are removed by size-selective sinks, and that the fate of the remaining debris is largely unknown. This work highlights the importance of understanding the fate of the remaining plastic debris in the ocean. We suggest that the ocean interior may be a significant sink for plastic debris. This would imply that the global accumulation of plastic in the ocean has been underestimated. We outline the possible consequences of this underestimation. This work is a first step toward understanding the global distribution of floating plastic and its impacts. It also provides the foundation for developing models to address the impacts of plastic pollution in the ocean. We anticipate that this work will stimulate research on the fate and impacts"

The heterochronic let-7 miRNA pathway plays a role in regulating fetal to adult hemoglobin expression in fish and mammals. Here we show that the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) plays a role in posttranscriptional heterochronic regulation of fetal hemoglobin in human erythroblasts. Overexpression of IGF2BP1 reverses the adult HbF/HbF ratio and HbF levels to near normal levels. These results suggest a mechanism for heterochronic regulation of hemoglobin expression in humans. We suggest that IGF2BP1 may be a candidate biomarker for fetal origins testing. Given the recent interest in the role of let-7 miRNA in hemoglobin regulation, this study may also be of interest to researchers studying the role of let-7 in hemoglobin regulation. Finally, the current study provides a mechanism for the role of IGF2BP1 in the development of the fetal limb and face in fish and mammals. Given the recent"

Mutations that cause cancer progression are often associated with loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), which activates transcription of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a critical transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism. SCD1 is a target of the lipid-modifying enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) and its activity is regulated by the protein complex known as the fatty acid synthase–stearyltetracaprin complex (FASL). Ferroptosis-inducing agents target only cells with FASN and SCD1, but not cells with FASN and FASL. Here, we show that combining ferroptosis induction with FASN inhibition is a powerful strategy to treat ferroptosis-resistant cancer. This is achieved by targeting FASL with an antibody against FASN, which sensitizes cells to ferroptosis by inducing saturated fatty acid"

We used decades of bird surveys and forest data to test whether the NWFP altered the composition of old-forest communities. Our models revealed that declines of older-forest–associated species accelerated on federal land, but that early-seral ecosystems stabilized. However, against our expectations, declines of birds associated with older forests accelerated. We highlight the importance of maintaining older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede their conservation and development. We anticipate that the creation of early-seral ecosystems will help stabilize bird populations associated with older forests. We also highlight the importance of monitoring and adaptive management to ensure that the NWFP continues to benefit wildlife and people. This policy is still evolving, and we encourage the public to continue tracking its effects.

Computational strategies are essential tools to this end. We present a rational design approach for the discovery of new acylide antibiotics. We screened a large compound collection for in vitro activity against six pathogens. The best candidate is synthetically more accessible, more active, and more potent than colistin, a drug known to be highly resistant to all known antibiotics. Notably, the best compounds combined with a colistin analog show efficacy against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. These results support the use of acylide antibiotics as a new class of drugs to combat the emergence of antibiotic resistance. They also indicate that computational strategies can be used to identify new lead compounds for antibiotic development. Given the emergence of antibiotic resistance, these strategies and new compounds based on them will be very useful. Their application is crucial to address the problem of the global threat to global health caused by the emergence of new antibiotic resistance.

We show that the record is consistent with a high-amplitude climate system forcing. The record provides insights into hydroclimate variability in a tropical lake basin and the influence on ecosystem dynamics, including the formation of a diverse of cichlid fish fauna. The record also demonstrates the potential for the lake to function as a paleoclimatic record.

This bolide impact is hypothesized to have caused the YD by causing the sudden cooling of the climate system. However, the isotopic evidence suggests that the bolide impact did not cause the YD. Instead, terrestrial Os is found in the sediments of the YD. The Os isotopic data suggest that the YD was caused by the terrestrial release of extraterrestrial Os. The Os isotopic data are consistent with a meteoritic origin of the Os, but the bulk sediment and/or magnetic grains/microspherules data are inconsistent with a meteoritic origin of Os.

We found that CTLA-4 is essential for immune self-tolerance and that CTLA-4 deficiency can be protective and, in some models of autoimmune disease, lead to fatal complications. We also found that CTLA-4 influences the response to immune stimulation in different tissues and cell types. Thus, our results indicate that CTLA-4 has dual functions in the control of immune responses and the survival of specific immune cells.

We show that even if a neural network is “deep” (i.e., has many layers), if the weights are not uniformly likely, then a small change in the input will cause large errors. We show that there does not exist a neural network with accuracy 1:2 between its output and the true data for any positive integers “K” and “L” and any deterministic algorithm for “training”; however, we show that there exists a deterministic algorithm that can compute a neural network with accuracy 1:3 for any positive integers “K” and “L”.

Mycobacterium lepromatosis is an unculturable human pathogen associated with the formation of callosal defects in children and a reactional state known as Lucio's phenomenon. By using deep sequencing with and without DNA enrichment, we obtained the near-complete genome sequence of M. lepromatosis and compared it with the other leprosy bacilli. We found that M. lepromatosis has retained all functions required to infect the peripheral nervous system and therefore may also be neuropathogenic. A phylogeographic survey of leprosy biopsies revealed that only one sample harbored M. lepromatosis while six others contained M. leprae. Thus, despite their ancient separation, the two leprosy bacilli are remarkably conserved and still cause similar pathologic conditions. This study provides a window into the evolutionary history of a mycobacterial pathogen.

Human-to-human transmission is possible but extremely rare, as is the case with modern plague epidemics. The last major global plague epidemic, the Black Death, occurred in the late 19th century, when the use of antibiotics and sterilization prevented most deaths. However, the disease can resurface with devastating effects, as shown today by plague in Germany, where human infections with Y. pestis are on the rise. We show that human ectoparasites, such as human lice or human fleas, can cause higher mortality than rodent vectors during past plague outbreaks. Thus, ectoparasites should be considered as potential transmission pathways for plague, currently only discussed in the context of rats. Our study suggests that human ectoparasites should be included in future modeling efforts to understand contemporary plague epidemics better. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of considering alternative transmission pathways for a better understanding of contemporary plague epidemiology.

Comparative studies on brain evolution have typically relied on relative brain size, a metric that is not directly informative about the brain’s functional capabilities. To reconstruct brain evolution across amniotes, we directly analyze the numbers of their neurons. We find that reptiles have the lowest brain-to-body-size ratios of any living animal group, resulting in neurons that are 20 times less numerous than in birds and twice as numerous as in mammals. We also find that the evolution of the brain in reptiles is driven by two independent major increases in the number of neurons, resulting in convergent scaling in the two amniote lineages. Finally, we show that the relationship between brain size and neuronal density is different in reptiles, where brain size correlates with neuronal density, and birds, where it does not. This has important implications for studies using relative brain size as a proxy when looking for evolutionary drivers of animal cognition.

We have used TRAP1-null cells and transient TRAP1 overexpression to show that TRAP1 regulates a metabolic switch between oxidative phosphorylation and aerobic glycolysis in immortalized mouse fibroblasts and in human tumor cells. TRAP1-deficiency promotes an increase in mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation, and in cellular accumulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, ATP and reactive oxygen species. These data suggest that, in some settings, TRAP1 may act as a tumor suppressor.

Here, we use a combination of techniques to understand how ADF/cofilin acts in the real-time conditions of a cell. We find that ADF/cofilin can sever filaments by boosting the severing rate constant. We also find that the force exerted by ADF/cofilin on the ends of filaments can boost the severing rate constant by a factor of 100. This mechanism is critical to boost the efficiency with which ADF/cofilin sever filaments in cells.

Ingestion of fructose relative to glucose also led to greater hunger and desire for food and a greater willingness to give up long-term monetary rewards to obtain immediate high-calorie foods. These findings suggest that ingestion of fructose relative to glucose activates brain regions involved in attention and reward processing and may promote feeding behavior. More generally, these findings have implications for the design of food-cue exposure therapies for obesity.

This driving force is an energetic optimum size at which thermoregulatory costs were low and feeding efficiency high. Rather than being freed from terrestrial constraints, aquatic mammals are constrained by the demands of being aquatic. These results are consistent with an energetic model of size increase and with a aquatic optimum size that is driving the size of the water-living mammals.

Thus, we have discovered a neuron as an immune cell effector in AD. Given the known proinflammatory nature of neurons, this raises the possibility that the immune system may begin its journey into AD in the brain. If so, this would represent an immune-related early target of AD, similar to the systemic immune system that is now recognized to be involved in the early pathology of AD.

We further argue that the gradual acclimatization of chickens in the Southern Levant and their gradual integration into the local economy, the latter accomplished in the Hellenistic period, was a crucial step in the adoption of chickens in European husbandry some 100 y later. Our results provide a more detailed view on the complex interactions between socioeconomics, ecology, and animal domestication in the Southern Levant during the first millennium B.C.E. and have important implications for our understanding of the early development of chicken husbandry in Europe.

It folds to a native state through a pathway that is distinct from the folding of most proteins. The intermediate that is formed in the MBP folding pathway is the focus of this study. The intermediate is composed of segments that are distant in the MBP sequence but adjacent in the native protein, and it is the first step on the MBP folding pathway. MBP then folds to the native state on a longer time scale, suggesting that the intermediate plays an important role in protein folding. These results provide important information about the folding mechanism of large proteins. The intermediate may be a key step in the folding of other large proteins. The method used to study the intermediate may be applicable to other large proteins.

This process is critical for initiating 5′ end-dependent degradation of those RNAs, potentially affecting bacterial adaptability to stress. Here, we show that the major cap-dissolving enzyme in Escherichia coli, ApaH, recognizes the 5′ end of RNA as a substrate, rather than the 3′ end, and recognizes the N-terminal δ-phosphate, rather than the β-phosphate, of the 5′ terminus for hydrolysis. This difference in substrate preferences allows us to study cap-dissolving in the context of the capped 5′ ends of RNA, allowing us to dissect out a unique step in the cap-dependent decapping process that we believe has major implications for disulfide-stress gene reprogramming. We demonstrate that the unusual manner in which ApaH recognizes capped substrates alters the way the enzyme cleaves 5′ ends, generating triphosphate-enriched 5′ termini that are more readily deprotected than the monophosphorylated 5′ terminus. Consequently, the rate at"

This finding, consistent with both geological and genomic data, provides a means by which the paleotemperature inferred from the isotopic record can be reconciled with the temperature environment in which ancestral enzymes evolved.

We developed a strategy to engineer a symbiosis in which the bacteria are only activated when in contact with host plants, and the bacteria are prevented from interacting with host plants. This represents a first step toward a sustainable agricultural practice based on a plant-controlled symbiosis. The barley line we describe represents a key milestone toward this goal. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is an important crop, and the barley plant depicted here could be used to develop other similar plants. The bacterial strain used in the study represents a unique, patented, N2-fixing consortium. We are currently working on a second barley line to further improve the performance of the symbiosis.

Data from monitoring records and community surveys provide evidence about how the program may affect forest outcomes. Community members perceived that the program’s monitors were new authorities with influence over forest management and that the monitors’ incentivized patrols were substitutes for unincentivized citizen patrols that inhibit timely community detection of and responses to deforestation.

Recently, biochemical analyses have identified secreted small ALK (ALKals) as potential ligands for human ALK (ALK). In the zebrafish, DrLtk, a homolog of human ALK, controls the development of iridophores, neural crest-derived pigment cells. Hence, the zebrafish system allows studying ALK/ALKals involvement in neural crest regulation in vivo. We show that zebrafish ALKals activate zebrafish ALK and human ALK driving downstream signaling events. Overexpression of the three DrAlkals drive ectopic iridophore development in zebrafish, whereas loss-of-function alleles lead to ectopic iridophore loss in zebrafish larvae and adults. Our results provide in vivo evidence of (i) activation of ALK/ALKals receptors by ALKALs and (ii) an involvement of these ligand–receptor complexes in iridophore development.

Despite sharing a common receptor, MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes demonstrate functional differences. First, whereas MERS-CoV prefers human DPP4 over bat DPP4 as its receptor, HKU4 shows the opposite trend. Second, in the absence of exogenous proteases, both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry into bat cells, whereas only MERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry into human cells.

The stability of this complex is integral to every aspect of lagging strand replication. Most of our understanding comes from Saccharomyces cerevisae where the extreme stability of the pol δ holoenzyme ensures that every nucleobase within an Okazaki fragment is faithfully duplicated but also necessitates an active displacement mechanism for polymerase recycling and exchange. However, the pol δ holoenzyme stability in human cells is unknown. We designed unique kinetic assays to analyze the processivity and stability of pol δ on undamaged DNA and on DNA damaged by a DNA lesion. Surprisingly, human pol δ maintains a loose association with PCNA while replicating, and such behavior has profound implications on Okazaki fragment synthesis in humans as it limits the processivity on undamaged DNA and promotes the rapid dissociation of pol δ on stalling at a DNA lesion.

Here we show that xanthocillin and other isocyanides from the xan BGC bind copper and mediate copper-dependent antimicrobial properties of the xan biosynthetic isocyanides. The xanthocillin-induced copper depletion of intracellular copper pools of A. fumigatus supports a role for the xan BGC in mediating interactions with competing microbes.

The mineral is also uncommon, with the only other known occurrences on Earth in laminated mudstones at Mount Sharp (Aeolis Mars) and Mount Halley (Compton Mars) on Mercury. The presence of tridymite in a mudstone is interpreted to be the result of a silicic volcanism system in Gale crater that produced high-SiO2 glass and volatile-rich sediments, with tridymite cementing such glass. The glass and tridymite are likely derived from the rim/cap region of the crater, and the sediments are derived from the inner/central crater. The glass and tridymite are likely sourced from a lake, and the sediments from a river system. The amorphous phases are silica-rich sediments derived from acidic leaching in the sediment source region. The amorphous phases and the crystalline"

We find that areas where late-spring frosts are more common are now forested and harbor tree species with evolved resistance strategies. However, areas where late-spring frosts are less common are becoming forested, and fast-evolving opportunistic species dominate the area occupied by these species in North America.

Using a Th17 transfer model of IBD, we find that IFN-γ deficiency in Th17 cells does not prevent disease, but does prevent the transition of Th17 precursors to Th1-like cells. We also find that Th17 cells can support the development of Th1 cells from naïve precursors, but only if they express both Stat4 and T-bet. Thus, Th17 cells are not only capable of producing IFN-γ, but also the transcription factors T-bet and Stat4, a role that supports their designation as “Th1-like” cells. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms by which Th17 cells support IBD pathogenesis and suggest that targeting Th17 cells may be a means of preventing or treating IBD. It is also worth noting that the expression of IFN-γ is not restricted to Th17 cells and can be produced by T cells and other cell types, suggesting that targeting the mechanisms of Th17 cell support may be necessary for therapy to be effective."

One-third of this feedback comes from increases in water vapor entering the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer, with the rest from increases in water vapor entering through the extratropical tropopause. This feedback is much larger than those for other greenhouse gases, and it increases the total climate sensitivity by a similar amount. It is thus very important in overall climate sensitivity, although its effect on the net climate effect is relatively modest.

Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution will permit a refined evaluation of the roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion, and establish an accurate time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms.

The disease killed an estimated a quarter of all Europeans during that time, making it one of the deadliest outbreaks in human history. The cause of the pandemic was not known, but evidence suggests that a bacterium called Yersinia pestis, which causes disease in humans, was introduced into Europe via the Mediterranean and Black Sea harbors. Here, we show that this bacterium was reintroduced into Europe on a regular basis, for ∼15 y, until it was not able to regain its initial population growth after repeated reintroductions. We propose that this reintroduction occurred when Asian flea vectors spread plague bacteria into European harbors, thereby illustrating the importance of climate as a driver of plague epidemics. Our study provides a clearer understanding of the epidemiology of the second plague pandemic. We show that the disease was not caused by a single epidemic-starting bacterium, but that the disease returned to Europe on regular intervals after substantial absence periods due to climate-driven reintroduction of plague bacteria from Asian reservoirs.The first thing you need to know"

One species, the asteroid (aster) star, is a common inhabitant of rocky shores in the Northeast Pacific Coast region of North America. Here, we present evidence that a rare disease, caused by a dense, odorless, and tasteless virus, has recently spread among asteroids at a rate of 20% per year. The disease causes behavioral changes, lesions, loss of turgor, limb autotomy, and death. Our results indicate that the disease is transmitted by the densovirus, a common virus-sized virus that has been implicated in disease outbreaks in other echinoderms. We hypothesize that the densovirus is the cause of the recent asteroid disease outbreak. Our results suggest that the densovirus is a likely candidate disease agent for asteroids. Therefore, we conclude that the densovirus is the most likely candidate to be responsible for asteroid disease.

There is an urgent need for novel and more efficient therapies, ideally targeting AML stem cells that are essential for maintaining the disease. The interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP; IL1R3) is expressed on candidate leukemic stem cells in the majority of AML patients, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. We show here that monoclonal antibodies targeting IL1RAP have strong antileukemic effects in xenograft models of human AML. We demonstrate that effector-cell–mediated killing is essential for the observed therapeutic effects and that natural killer cells constitute a critical human effector cell type. Because IL-1 signaling is important for the growth of AML cells, we generated an IL1RAP-targeting antibody capable of blocking IL-1 signaling and show that this antibody can be targeted the growth of human AML cells. This provides important evidence in support of IL1RAP as a target for antibody-based treatment of AML. We also describe the isolation of AML cells from human tumor specimens and show that IL1RAP"

We used a grid-based approach to sample at high resolution the genomic diversity (including maternal lineages, paternal lineages, and genome-wide data) across 257 villages and 2,704 Malagasy individuals to investigate the settlement history. We find that Madagascar has a high genetic diversity, but a recent colonization from Southeast Asia and the Middle East. We also find that there are geographic influences on the present genomic diversity, showing that the admixture was sex biased and happened heterogeneously across Madagascar, and that there are also indications of genetic flow between the islands. We show that a few decades is sufficient to produce detectable genetic structure in human populations. We highlight the importance of considering sex biases in the analysis of genomic data. This study provides a high-resolution view of the genetic diversity in Madagascar, which will be instrumental in addressing a number of outstanding questions, including the origins of the island and"

While most sRNAs are considered “noncoding,” a few have been found to also encode a small protein. Here we describe a 164-nucleotide RNA that encodes a 28-amino acid, membrane-associated protein. The RNA and protein interact with the aerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, increasing dehydrogenase activity. Overexpression of the RNA results in growth defect in galactose medium, whereas translation of the RNA interferes with the observed repression of the gene encoding the galactose-binding protein by the RNA and base-pairing competition with the protein. We hypothesize that the protein-coding RNA functions in conjunction with the noncoding RNA to regulate a biological process. These findings expand the utility of the RNA-protein interaction assay as a means to identify potential biological functions for the RNA. We also describe a role for a single-protein-coding RNA in regulating a cellular process. Because the protein encoded by the RNA is a component of the dehydrogenase complex, the RNA may regulate a cellular process by"

We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a human antibody P36-5D2, which is effective against SARS-CoV-2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma but not Delta. We show that our CDR optimization can improve its binding affinity against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta. We have also demonstrated that our algorithm can identify CDR changes that alleviate the impact of two Omicron mutations on the epitope. These results highlight the power of our approach in sequence optimization and its potential application to engineering other protein molecules.

The CPC survey, which has been conducted for over 40 years, employs a large number of crop experts who provide crop ratings based on a set of visual inspection rules. We show that the ratings from crop experts capture the complexities of assessing the “status” of a crop better than any model or remote sensing data. We propose a quantitative Crop Condition Index based on the CPC survey and demonstrate how this index can be used to monitor crop status and provide earlier and more precise predictions of crop yields than official USDA forecasts released midseason. The approach proposed here combines the strengths of expert surveys with the continuous, unobtrusive, and continuous observations from operational satellite sensors. The approach is easily extensible to other crops and other countries. The key contributions are the development of a statistical model for continuous assessment of crop condition based on crop expert surveys and the CPC survey"

We demonstrate that this mechanism is sensitive to context and serial order which makes it suitable for temporal integration in sequence processing within the language domain.

We find that, although there is a general increase in respiration with increasing soil temperature, there is no significant difference in the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration between control and warmed plots in all biomes. This consistent temperature-independent response across all biomes suggests that respiration rates will increase with increasing ambient temperatures, contrary to the results from multiple single-site studies. Our analysis adds a unique cross-biome perspective on the temperature response of soil respiration, information critical to improving our mechanistic understanding of how soil carbon dynamics change with climatic warming. If warming increases the frequency of extremely warm years, then future increases in ambient temperatures may cause a shift in the timeframe over which soil respiration is responsive to temperature, potentially resulting in a net increase in warming.

We show that the loss of photosynthesis is linked to the parasite’s dependence on the host for its life cycle, rather than the loss of symbiotic photosynthesis. The parasite’s dependence on the host and the loss of photosynthesis are linked by the loss of functional constraints on the plastid genome. Evolutionary rates and selection pressure coevolve with macrostructural and microstructural changes, the extent of functional reduction, and the establishment of the obligate parasitic lifestyle. Our findings suggest that the elevation of evolutionary rates and the intensification of selection during the functional reduction process relate to the modified protein turnover rates in heterotrophic plastids.

These genes all encode proteins with diverse molecular functions, including axon guidance and Rho-family small proteins. Thus, the divergent functions of the ASD-associated genes may contribute to the complexity of ASD symptoms. Interestingly, activation of Rac1-dependent forgetting was the core mechanism for memory formation, and the same mechanism also regulated forgetting for other functions, including social behavior and reversal learning.

The immunosuppressant protein (MTX) was concentrated in the submandibular salivary gland of the bat, Myotis pilosus, and selectively inhibited the leukotriene-A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) function of the aminopeptidase, which is critical for the host to resist viral infection. MTX did not affect the protease activities of the host and facilitated viral infection. This study provides deeper insight into immunologically privileged sites for microbial community residence in bats and supports the therapeutic potential of targeting MTX-LTA4H. In addition, we demonstrate that MTX can induce immune tolerance by reducing host immune responses against viral infection and pathogenicity. These findings provide a basis for the development of antiviral therapeutics against pandemic influenza and other viral diseases.

Here, we show that the proteins that form inclusions in ALS subtypes 3 and 4 are not merely a subset of the native interaction partners of these three proteins, which are themselves highly supersaturated. To explain the presence of coaggregating proteins in inclusions in the brain and spinal cord, we observe that they have an average supersaturation even greater than the average supersaturation of the native interaction partners in motor neurons, but not when scores are generated from an average of other human tissues. These results suggest that inclusion bodies in ALS subtypes 3 and 4 result from a set of proteins metastable in motor neurons, and thus prone to aggregation upon a disease-related progressive collapse of protein homeostasis in this specific setting.

If sea level continues to change at this rate and acceleration, sea-level rise by 2100 (∼65 cm) will be more than double the amount if the rate was constant at 3 mm/y.

Cleaving the spike proteins before cell attachment allows the virus to escape receptor-induced conformational changes that would trigger virus particle fusion. Thus, by determining when spike proteins are cleaved, MERS-CoV can more precisely tune virus infection into relevant cell types for cell-to-cell infection. These insights may explain the reason for high disease severity in some populations and the lower severity of disease in others, as well as the seasonality of MERS outbreaks.

Although many attempts have been made to generate ECs from pluripotent stem cells, the minimum number of transcription factors that specialize in directly inducing vascular ECs remains undefined. Here, by screening 18 transcription factors that are important for both endothelial and hematopoietic development, we demonstrate that ETV2 alone directly converts primary human adult skin fibroblasts into functional vascular endothelial cells (ETVECs). In coordination with endogenous FOXC2 in fibroblasts, transduced ETV2 elicits expression of multiple key endothelial development factors, including FLI1, ERG, and TAL1, and induces expression of endothelial functional molecules, including EGFL7 and von Willebrand factor. ETVECs exhibit endothelial characteristics in vitro and form mature functional vasculature in Matrigel plugs transplanted in NOD SCID mice. Our study indicates that the creation of ETVECs provides further understanding of human EC development induced by ETV2.

Islet-specific STING knockout reduced insulin sensitivity and impaired insulin secretion, suggesting that STING is required for normal β-cell function. We found that Pax6 is the transcription factor that might be associated with defective insulin secretion in STING-βKO mice.

Using in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that this interaction takes place in infected cells and is required for optimal viral replication. Disruption of this interaction did not affect the HA titer of the mutant viruses, suggesting that the same amount of viral RNA was produced. However, it nonspecifically decreased the amount of viral RNA in the viral particles, resulting in an eightfold increase in empty viral particles. Competition experiments indicated that this interaction favored copackaging of the interacting viral RNA segments. The interaction we identified involves regions not previously designated as packaging signals and is not widely conserved among influenza A virus.

The coral–algal symbiosis is a key component of these systems. This symbiosis relies on efficient nutrient cycling and carbon translocation between the coral and algal partners. We show that heat stress increases the metabolic energy demand of the coral host, which is compensated by the catabolic degradation of amino acids. The resulting shift from net uptake to release of ammonium by the coral holobiont subsequently promoted the growth of the algal symbionts and retention of photosynthates. These processes form a feedback loop that gradually leads to the symbiosis’ functional breakdown. We provide evidence that altered nutrient cycling is a key driver in the early heat stress response, directly contributing to the breakdown of the coral–algal symbiosis.

However, when this pathway is inactivated to promote tumorigenesis, the commensal microbiome is activated, leading to a dysbiotic microbiome–intestinal barrier interaction that promotes tumor growth. We identify a JNK-dependent feedback amplification loop between the commensal microbiome and intestinal tumorigenesis that controls the integrity of the intestinal barrier and host–microbe homeostasis. Our study highlights the importance of controlling JNK signaling to maintain epithelial barrier function and host–microbe homeostasis.

This regeneration type is triggered by physical damage to the axon of a specific neuronal type, and is mediated by a previously unknown form of axon outgrowth. Our study unites disparate forms of regeneration to uncover fresh molecular insights into the intrinsic regenerative capacity of the CNS.

We show that certification has limited impact on total forest loss or fire activity in oil palm plantations. However, certification is associated with reduced deforestation in peatlands, and certification requires peatland owners to take steps to restore peat as a buffer against fire. Routine monitoring of forest cover is also necessary to ensure that certified plantations hold sufficient residual forest to serve as a buffer against future forest loss. These findings suggest that the RSPO certification system has limited potential to meet the environmental and conservation goals of major palm oil producers and countries. Our findings also highlight the importance of local action to conserve forests in Indonesia, where most plantations are certified. More research is needed on how to improve certification systems to achieve the full potential of this voluntary approach to forest conservation. We leave open the question of whether certification is the optimal or most effective way to support sustainable palm oil production and the broader conservation and climate goals of the RSPO.

We discovered that the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) binds to the EXO70 (exocyst component of 70 kDa) subunit of the exocyst complex, resulting in inhibition of exocytosis and endosomal recycling. We demonstrated that ES2 can enhance plant vacuolar trafficking in both plant and human cells. This study provides a way to target the exocyst complex for treating human diseases. We provide a unique view into the function of the EXO70 protein and reveal the importance of the N terminus of the protein. ES2 treatment results in increased resistance of plant cells to drought stress and enhanced root exocytosis of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT). These findings provide a promising target for treating human diseases. This study begins to fill the gap in our understanding of the function of the EXO70 protein and how it is regulated by small molecules. This study also provides a model system for studying exocytosis regulation using"

In vertebrates, sex chromosomes are a major determinant of sex differences in the gonad and throughout the organism. Sex determination is controlled by a single gene, and in many species of fish, sex is determined by a single allele segregating within a single sex determination locus (SOLD) on a sex chromosomes. We show that polygenic sex determination produces a mosaic of sex-linked and gonadal phenotypes, resulting in four possible sex classes: ZZXX females, ZWXX females, ZWXY males, and ZZYY males. We show that the evolution of a newly acquired sex determiner can create additional axes of phenotypic variation for varied traits, including morphological and behavioral traits. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the genetic basis of sex-linked and gonadal phenotypes in species with polygenic sex determination. We also highlight the importance of considering the mosaic nature of sex-linked and gonadal phenotypes in species with polygenic sex determination. Understanding the evolution of sex determination alleles in species with complex sex chromosomes is critical for understanding the"

Here we show that the Fe ion plays a key role in the oxidation and degradation of these photochemicals. We found that the Fe ion promotes the photochemical reactions that degrade the lipofuscin biopolymer, thereby protecting RPE cells from damaging reactive oxygen species. We also show that the Fe ion promotes the formation of dicarbonyls and the oxidation of A2E, which are key in the pathogenesis of photoreceptor cell degeneration. These findings indicate that Fe ion serves as a key player in photoreceptor cell protection and that Fe chelation may be a useful strategy for photoreceptor protection. In addition, our work sheds light on Fe’s role in the redox active energy transfer that occurs in the retina. These findings suggest that Fe ion serves as a key redox partner in the energy transfer that occurs in the retina. These findings suggest that Fe ion serves as a key redox"

However, in some predators, these changes are localized in separate structures dedicated to prey capture. We study how siphonophore specialists and generalists evolve, and what morphological changes are associated with these transitions. Instead of a dead end, we found that siphonophore tentillum morphology has strong evolutionary associations with prey type, and suggest that shifts between prey types are linked to shifts in the morphology, mode of evolution, and evolutionary correlations of tentilla and their nematocysts. The evolutionary history of siphonophore specialization helps build a broader perspective on predatory niche diversification via morphological innovation and evolution.The first thing you need to know about me is that I love to travel.

Here we report a new early Pleistocene hand fossil from Kaitio, Kenya, that dates to ∼1.42 Mya and provides the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of a key characteristic of modern human hand morphology. This fossil has allowed us to refine our understanding of the origin of these features and to date the fossil to the broadest time interval documented for the evolution of this hand morphology. This work also highlights the importance of East Africa as a time interval important in the evolution of human-like hand morphology. Until this fossil is included in future comprehensive hand studies, it will be difficult to interpret the broad range of human hand morphology in the earliest Pleistocene humans. We suggest that this new fossil and the broader time interval reported here should be considered to represent the earliest unambiguous evidence for the evolution of the human hand. We also suggest that the emergence of the radial carpometacarpal joint in the human hand may have been influenced by the expansion of the"

Folate one-carbon units support purine and thymidine synthesis, and thus cell growth. SHMT is constitutively expressed in most mammalian tissues, but is highly up-regulated in cancer. We report that SHMT is a metabolic target in human colon cancer. We identify small-molecule dual SHMT1/2 inhibitors that rescue cancer cell growth when inhibited, and paradoxically increase cancer cell death when inhibited. Our work suggests that SHMT is a promising therapeutic target in cancer and underscores the importance of one-carbon metabolism in disease. We describe a metabolic drug target in colon cancer that may be further explored for its ability to restore folate metabolism in cancer and support cancer cell death.

This study finds that deforestation over a 5-y period led to a reduction in people’s fruit and vegetable consumption and thus vitamin A adequacy of diets. We show that deforestation caused by agricultural intensification can have a causal effect on people’s diets and that this effect is magnified when considered in a contextualized way by considering the role of natural landscapes such as forests. The results highlight the importance of considering the role of landscapes in meeting nutrition goals and offer a potential “win–win” solution in terms of improving agriculture and nutrition. More broadly, the results have important implications for conservation and environmental policy makers given that forests are largely overlooked in strategies to improve nutrition, but offer potential “win–wins” in terms of meeting nutrition goals as well as conservation and environmental goals.

However, the higher capacity has been accompanied by higher vehicle weights that increase risks of subsoil compaction. We show that while surface contact stresses remained nearly constant over the course of modern mechanization, subsoil stresses have propagated into deeper soil layers and now exceed mechanical limits for soil ecological functioning. We developed a global map for delineating subsoil compaction susceptibility based on mechanization level, mean tractor size, soil texture, and climatic conditions. The alarming trend of 20% subsoil compaction, with potential loss of productivity, calls for a more stringent design of farm machinery that considers intrinsic subsoil mechanical limits. As the total weight of modern harvesters is now approaching that of the largest animals that walked Earth, the sauropods, a paradox emerges of potential prehistoric subsoil compaction. We hypothesize that unconstrained roaming of sauropods would have had similar adverse effects on land productivity. We suggest ecological strategies for reducing subsoil compaction, including fixed foraging trails, which could help maintain productive land"
